    MADAM,

            Your Royal Highness having been pleased to inspect, with
some apparent interest, the portfolios of original drawings from which
the illustrations of the annexed volume have been selected, I have
ventured to solicit permission to inscribe the Work to Your Royal
Highness.

  It has little merit, perhaps, except fidelity of representation.
But, claiming this for it, I presume to hope that it may obtain Your
Royal Highness’s indulgent consideration, even though it should be
found more deficient in other respects than I am willing to believe.

      I have the honour to be,

                 MADAM,

              With profound respect,

                     Your Royal Highness’s

                          Most obedient

                               Humble Servant,

                                        THE AUTHOR.




                              =PREFACE.=
                               * * * * *


The following work contains the observations made by the Author during
a journey performed by him in 1833 into the higher parts of Ethiopia.
It is illustrated by engraved representations of the most remarkable
objects in that country, from large drawings, finished on the spot by
himself, or under his direction.

The monuments of Egypt, the most wonderful ever reared by human hands,
have been described by numerous travellers, though there is still ample
room for more full and accurate delineation. Even the antiquities
of Lower Nubia have of late been repeatedly visited. But Ethiopia,
above the second cataract, including the metropolis of the ancient
kingdom of Meroe, had been explored by very few Europeans, and only
two Englishmen; yet it abounds with monuments rivalling those of Egypt
in grandeur and beauty, and possessing, in some respects, a superior
interest. According to Heeren, Champollion, Rosellini, and other
eminent inquirers, whose judgment was confirmed by my own observations,
this was the land whence the arts and learning of Egypt, and ultimately
of Greece and Rome, derived their origin. In this remarkable country we
behold the earliest efforts of human science and ingenuity.

Such were the objects which induced the Author to encounter the
difficulties and hardships of a journey into the upper valley of
the Nile. It were to be wished, that the task had fallen into abler
hands; yet he may be permitted to mention, that he had, to a certain
extent, been prepared for it, by a series of years spent in Italy,
Sicily, Greece, and other countries, distinguished by splendid
remains of antiquity. He resided afterwards for a year in Upper
Egypt, delineating its most remarkable edifices, and studying the
sculptures and the hieroglyphics. He had thus acquired considerable
experience in architectural drawing, and he took care, by the use of
the _camera lucida_, to secure the accuracy of his outline. He had,
likewise, the good fortune to engage the services of a very able
Italian artist. No spot of any consequence was left till a leisurely
and careful delineation had been made of every object of interest
which it contained. It is therefore hoped, that a tolerably complete
and accurate delineation has now been made of the most important
antiquities of Ethiopia.

Although the illustration of ancient monuments formed the Author’s
primary object, he has not neglected to make observations on the
various and often singular tribes by whom the country is at present
inhabited. He has been enabled to exhibit them under a new and very
peculiar aspect, as no longer proud and independent, but reduced
to complete subjection under the severe sway of that extraordinary
character, Mohammed Ali, Pasha of Egypt. It is hoped that some light
has been thrown upon the Turkish system of government, particularly in
the provinces. Perhaps, also, the narrative of his journeys through
extensive tracts of desert may be read with some interest. The original
form of a journal has been retained, as that in which the impressions
of the observer are given in the most faithful and brief manner.

In the concluding chapters, the Author has endeavoured to collect
into one view the scattered notices which alone record the history,
commerce, and arts of the celebrated kingdom of Meroe, and to
illustrate these by recent materials, collected by himself, and others,
from the sculptures and inscriptions still remaining. Lamentably
deficient as our information is on this important subject, it may be
interesting to find the few particulars related in ancient history, and
particularly in the sacred volume, in many respects so fully confirmed
by the evidence of existing monuments.[1]

_Feb._ 1. 1833. Having spent twelve months in the valley of the Nile,
I had designed to leave Thebes this week, and return to Cairo. To
this long period had an intended stay of a few weeks been protracted,
in consequence of my daily increasing devotion to the fascinating
but laborious study of Egyptian antiquities. I cannot, however,
escape some uncomfortable feelings when I contrast the prospect now
before me, of privation and dreariness in a long journey through the
desert, with the hopes I had indulged of returning now to Europe,
to the enjoyments of social and domestic intercourse, and the
refinements and comforts of civilised life. My boat was ready, and all
preparations made for my voyage down the Nile, when its direction was
changed by the arrival of Signor Bandoni, a skilful Italian artist,
whom I had long anxiously expected. I then immediately determined
to proceed with my projected journey to the antiquities of Meroe,
and thus complete my investigation of the architectural wonders
of the Nile. Wearied, however, with my previous labours at Thebes,
and in the Oasis Magna, I had felt reluctant to make this arduous
attempt without the assistance of an artist. Had I now lacked courage,
the redoubtable appearance of my Lucchese ally would have inspired
me with resolution to encounter the wildest Bishareen of the Nubian
desert, or the hungriest lion of Ethiopia. The Signor brings with
him his bosom companion, a double-barrelled Spanish _escopette_, of
awe-inspiring calibre, the destructive powers of which, he assures me,
have been frequently proved upon the turtle doves in the palm groves
of the Nile: he animates me also with the assurance, that “non ha
niente paura;” nor, since his landing in these barbarous regions,
has he yet known bodily fear, except once, and that by mistake,
when scared by the _lion-like_ roar of a buffalo, near the base of
Pompey’s Pillar. The valley of the Nile, as far as Wady Halfah,
has been described by many. Only six or seven Europeans have
penetrated beyond that cataract; and, unfortunately, all even of
those were not sufficiently acquainted with Egyptian antiquities,
and competent, as artists, to give a satisfactory description and
correct delineations of the interesting remains which still exist in
those remote regions.[2] In using the term acquainted, I do not mean
to state that any person has penetrated very deeply into the mysteries
of Egyptian lore, much less can I pretend to have lifted “the veil
of Isis which no mortal has yet raised;” but even a slight knowledge
of the recent discoveries in hieroglyphics gives to the traveller
of the present day an advantage over, perhaps, even the most learned
travellers who visited this country before the discoveries of Young,
Wilkinson, Champollion, and Rosellini. Egypt is no longer a field for
speculative ingenuity and brilliant imagination. The daylight has
appeared, and the efforts of talent and perseverance have cleared
away many of the difficulties which obstructed the first labourers
in this rich mine of antiquarian research. Enough is already known
of hieroglyphics to make the subject be duly appreciated by literary
men, and we may confidently expect important information from that
source. The drawings which have hitherto been made in Upper Nubia
are considered to be very inaccurate; much has been left undone, and
the hieroglyphics have been but partially and imperfectly copied;
while many of the inscriptions are totally unknown. Aware of these
circumstances, and also that not a drawing or description of the
antiquities of Meroe has yet been published in England, and hoping
that my labours may be of some service to those interested in these
subjects, I leave Thebes to encounter again the fatigues and perils
of the desert; but Meroe is before me, the probable birth-place of
the arts and sciences.

I bade adieu, last night, to my kind friends, Mr. and Mrs. Hay, whose
society, attention, and valuable services, have been an indescribable
resource to me during my long residence at Thebes. I felt how
gratifying it is, in setting out on a journey of this description,
to have the warm wishes of others that it may be successful. “Bring
as many drawings as you can,” was the good advice given to me,
and which I intend to follow.

I cannot perform impossibilities, by bringing the antiquities
themselves; but I trust and hope, with the assistance of my
camera lucida, my long experience in drawing that peculiar style
of architecture and sculpture, and last, though not least, the
valuable aid of my excellent Italian artist, Signor B., I shall be
able to bring back drawings and plans which shall have the merit and
value of strict accuracy. But I must disclaim, in the outset, any
idea of adding much to the geographical knowledge of the interior
of Africa. The object of my journey is Meroe, and to elucidate
the existing vestiges of the ancient grandeur of the kingdom of
Ethiopia. The wind this day has been favourable; but there was so
little of it, that our progress has not been great.

_Feb._ 2. We arrived at Esneh this morning at eight, and remained
until ten. I wished to see the Governor, to procure from him a letter
to the Nazr of Assuan, requesting him to assist me in procuring
camels; but I was told that he was asleep, and would not be visible
till late in the afternoon. It is now the month of Ramadan, during
which the law forbids them to eat or drink before sunset; however,
the Turkish grandees avoid this privation by turning night into day,
sleeping the greater part of the latter, and devoting the former
to business and their pleasures. This manner of keeping their
fast is somewhat similar to the devotee Peter Pindar describes,
who, when sentenced to perform a pilgrimage with peas in his shoes,
wisely took the liberty to boil his peas. The wind being favourable,
I could not wait the awakening of the Mahmoor.

_Assuan.—Feb. 5._ In our journey of this and the two preceding days,
we have only had six to seven hours of wind; however, this afternoon,
we arrived at Assuan, and I immediately waited on the Nazr to procure
camels. On entering a Turkish divan, the traveller is merely required
to make a grave bow, placing his right hand to his left breast,
and to seat himself on the divan in the Turkish style, which, for
the information of those readers who have not been in the country,
I should say is exactly that easy position, which it seems in Europe
tailors only are privileged to assume. When seated, he usually salutes
the great man again in the same manner as before; but if the latter
be of very high rank, it is better to show respect by placing the
right hand, first, to the lips, and then, above the forehead. A few
complimentary speeches are now exchanged; such as “How do you do?”
“What a tall man you are!” “What a fine beard!” “You are
like one of us!” Welcome and thanks. Coffee is then presented to the
traveller. The Pasha gives pipes to noblemen at his own divan only;
but every English gentleman has a right to expect one, or to smoke
his own at the divan of any of his subordinate officers. The Turk,
if he is only a Katshef or Nazr, ought to make a kind of half rise
from his seat when the traveller enters; but it is very seldom that
his pride and desire of appearing a great man in his little court
permits him to show this courtesy. All the Turks possess, or have
the power of assuming, an apparently natural dignity of manner. The
liberated slave, raised suddenly to rank and authority, seems always
at his ease, as if born to the station that he fills. Education, that
is, the having learned with difficulty to read and write a letter
of four or five lines, makes no distinction, being an attainment in
which those of the highest rank are sometimes deficient. I presented
to the Nazr, a common-looking fellow, the Pasha’s firman, which,
as usual, he kissed and placed to his forehead. As soon as his
Coptic writer had read it to him, he ordered me a pipe, an attention
previously omitted, and in the mean time offered me his own; but
my servant at that moment entered with mine. I had ordered it,
because my not assuming my right in this trifling etiquette would
have made me less respected, not only by the Nazr and his court, but,
what was of real consequence, by the Arabs, who were to accompany me
across the desert to Berber. Generally I hate etiquette and ceremony,
as the north and north-east winds of society; but I have found from
experience, that with the Turks it is absolutely necessary to insist
upon their observance. Travellers, in their ignorance of Eastern
manners, are generally too humble to them. If even a Katshef pays
them a visit, they rise from their seats and bow, as often and as
low as if he were a monarch. Accordingly, when they return the
visit, they have the mortification to perceive, that the Turk,
misconstruing such European courtesy into obsequiousness, and an
acknowledgment of inferiority, does not even rise to receive him;
but, with a slight condescending nod, desires his visitor to be
seated, and of course has less regard to his requests in matters
of real importance. The days of Burckhardt are past. The traveller
throughout Mohammed Ali’s dominions has now no occasion to submit
to any indignity, or even incivility: his forbearance will gain him
nothing except the consciousness of having fruitlessly submitted to
the contempt of an ignorant and illiterate barbarian. I have dwelt
upon this little circumstance, from my experience of its importance
for the guidance of future travellers. The Nazr, during the rest of
my visit, was profuse in his offers of services. He informed me, that
the Government were themselves in want of camels; but that I should
have the first that could be procured, which he hoped would be next
day. Along with the Nazr was a Bey, just returned across the desert
from Berber. I could get little information from him; and, indeed,
could not ask many questions of him, as I found he had just been
removed from the government in disgrace, on account of extortion. I
might have guessed the cause from his physiognomy, for I have rarely
seen so villainous a countenance. He did not seem neglected in his
adversity, as numbers of Turks were visiting him, each kissing his
hand, and wishing him a speedy return to the favour of the Pasha. He
gave me no flattering description of the desert, telling me I should
feel it bitterly cold at night, and should spend nine or ten days,
without finding any water at all drinkable. The sorry condition of
his camels, too, strongly confirmed the truth of this account.

_Feb._ 6. I heard this morning, with surprise, that I should probably
have to wait a week longer before procuring camels. Knowing the
Turks to be adepts at procrastination, I went to the Nazr, and
urged the necessity of my starting immediately. At my request, he
sent for the Sheakh of the Ababdes, the tribe who provide camels to
caravans and travellers for the journey between Assuan and Makkarif,
the capital of Berber. They act also as carriers to the Red Sea,
the Oasis Magna, along the Nile to Dongolah, and also across the
western side of the great Nubian desert. The residence of the
Sheakh being two hours distant, he did not arrive before this
evening. I was agreeably struck with his appearance; he was a man
of middle size; extremely regular features; a calm and dignified
manner; a benevolent, and at the same time noble, expression of
countenance. His dress was remarkably neat and clean. His turban
and long linen gown were beautifully white and of good materials. He
promised us that we should have camels the next day, and we agreed
that the price should be seventy piastres for the use of each during
the journey to Makkarif, where, it is said, we shall arrive in twenty
days. It is rather annoying to be thus detained, since every day is
of consequence, the season being so far advanced; but it is some
consolation that our time has not been quite lost. The island of
Elephantine is no longer adorned with temples. Some ruins of walls,
a rude statue of Osiris, slight traces of the temple of Chnubis,
and the Nilometer, are all the remains which now exist. The northern
part resembles a garden ornamented with beautiful groves of palm trees
and the richest cultivation. Syene offers still less to interest the
antiquarian, but much to strengthen the believer in Holy Writ. The
prophetic denunciation of Ezekiel is fulfilled. The tower of Syene
has truly fallen from the pride of her power. The ruin of a pier,
partly Roman but chiefly Arab, and an insignificant fragment of a
temple, are the only vestiges of this once important city. Yet the
natural scenery around is still beautiful, and the views from it,
as well as from the Island of Elephantine, are the most lovely in
Egypt. The castle of Syene, built by the Bosnian soldiers, forms,
even in its ruined state, a highly picturesque object. Several of
the descendants of the Bosnian soldiers are living at Assuan, and
in Lower Nubia. I met with one as far south as Amarah.[3]

_Feb._ 7. No camels are arrived; we are obliged, therefore, to
delay another day. This requires some patience, when every thing is
prepared for our expedition. I superintended this morning the filling
of the skins with water: I am sorry to find them very indifferent,
although the best I could procure.

_Philæ.—Feb._ 9. After repeated applications to the Governor,
I have procured at last nine camels and two dromedaries for
ourselves. Any complaint of this delay would be unreasonable,
otherwise than as a misfortune. Several Turks in the employment
of the Pasha have been detained for want of them during this
last fortnight; notwithstanding which, from their knowledge of his
favour for travellers, they have given me the preference. Our start,
however, is at last made. I have been very anxious to leave Assuan,
having perceived an increasing disinclination on the part of my
artist and servants to undertake the journey. The tales of some
Arab merchants have excited among them so much alarm, that all my
powers of persuasion and remonstrance were necessary to keep them
from defection. They have unfortunately heard the exclamations
of some of my old Nubian friends, the Rais of the Cataract and
others, when I told them I was going to Shendy. “Wonderful! God
is great! but are you not afraid to go into such a hot country,
where it rains fire?” It has been no easy task to persuade them
that a passage of eight or ten days over a desert, without water,
and of twenty days without intermission on the backs of camels, can
be an easy undertaking. I hope, for their sakes, we shall not have
to suffer much: as to myself, I feel more indifferent. I am going to
Meroe; and the idea of the desert, notwithstanding Burckhardt’s,
and still more Bruce’s, description of it, does not damp my ardour.

_Sail on the Nile.—Feb._ 10. We left Philæ this morning at half
past seven, entered into the mountains, and at three o’clock
descended again into the valley of the Nile; at a quarter to six,
we pitched our tents on the banks of the river. The mountains we
have passed are of the same character as at the cataract, chiefly
of syenite, the exterior of which is darkened by the sun. The
formation consists of the same round blocks, appearing at a distance
as disjoined. The place where we are encamped, and indeed all the
country we have traversed to-day, is miserably poor. The strip
of cultivated land is not an eighth of a mile in breadth. Barley,
cotton, and _sherangig_ are all that the country produces. The latter,
which forms the chief food of the Nubian, is a hard disagreeable
kind of pea, which no culinary art can render palatable to European
taste. We have passed several small villages, each containing from
ten to twenty houses. This morning we met a troop of cavalry from
Khartoun, which had passed the desert, of which they gave us any
thing but an encouraging description. They say we shall be ten days
in crossing it; and “take care of your water” is their constant
advice. The same admonition has been dunned in our ears more than
a hundred times since the day that we arrived at Assuan.

_Marwal.—Feb._ 11. We set out this morning at half past seven,
and proceeded, for some time, on the banks of the river. Nearly
opposite to the small temple of Kardassy, we again turned into the
mountains. There the granite chain suddenly ceases, and the hills are
of sandstone, until opposite Tafey, where again, for a short space,
they are of granite, and then of sandstone. Arriving at the district
of Kalabshy, I found the mountains partially composed of sandstone,
and immediately afterwards of granite. The belt of cultivated land,
on both sides of the river, is always extremely narrow, seldom
above fifty paces wide; and sometimes the rocks extend to the water,
scarcely leaving a narrow and dangerous path. My own camel fell, and
also the one conveying the baggage. This is the first time that such
an accident has occurred to me with these animals; and I ought to add,
not to have the appearance of contradicting what I have elsewhere
said, that any horse, or even mule, would have run considerable risk
of stumbling over these slippery granite rocks. Before leaving Assuan,
a fortune-teller came to my tent: being busy at the time, I ordered
her away rather angrily. In her rage, she exclaimed that I should
fall from my camel. I did not expect that her malediction would be
so soon fulfilled. I had quite forgotten the circumstance; but my
Arabs, shaking their heads, soon reminded me of it. My fall might
have been serious, as such accidents with this animal generally are,
if the creature had rolled immediately; but, the instant it stumbled,
I leaped off, and escaped unhurt. Barley, sherangig, and cotton are
the only productions I have observed this day: they are often mingled
together, in patches, upon the same field. I observed the peasants
breaking the sandstone and spreading it on the ground. The best way
of seeing to advantage the scenery on the Nile is, certainly, to
ride on its banks: in a boat the effect is lost. The finest view we
have had this morning, was in descending from the mountains opposite
Tafey. The basalt and red but exteriorly dark-coloured granite,
contrasted with the light red sand of the desert, similar rocks and
sands in the distance, in the midst the serpentine river with its
verdant banks, adorned with groves of palm trees and the interesting
remains of temples, all illumined with the clearest blue sky and the
most gorgeous sunset, formed often a scene to which few painters
could do justice. Though not romantic nor strikingly picturesque,
according to the original import of those terms, yet the extraordinary
contrast and magical effect produced by this wonderful combination of
brilliant colours, are magnificent, and present almost insuperable
difficulties to the artist who attempts faithfully to delineate
such a landscape. Three hours before arriving here, we passed the
small village of Abaho, in which I counted nearly thirty houses. The
inhabitants are evidently wretchedly poor; however, they enjoy the
luxury of idleness. Very few seemed engaged in any occupation. One
woman I observed spinning cotton and two or three busy about their
domestic concerns; but the many were enjoying _il dolce fur niente_
of the Italians. They were almost all miserably clad; the clothes
of both sexes were in rags, the children naked, and girls from
fourteen to sixteen, with beautiful forms, and extremely graceful
and elegant in their movements, had merely a covering which extended
from the waist to a little above the knee. This ceinture, or _rat_,
as it is called in Arabic, is made of thin thongs of hippopotamus
hide, and fancifully ornamented with beads and small shells. The
number of thongs is so great, that it fully serves its purpose as
a covering. They wear it till they are married; an event, however,
which often takes place before they are twelve years of age.

_Dacker.—Feb._ 12. We left the village of Marwal at seven,
and encamped here at sunset. Our route has this day, also, been
alternately in the mountains and on the banks of the river. We
observe the same poverty, the same sterility; villages of about
a dozen houses each, constructed, in the rudest manner, of stones
piled on each other. The cultivated land on the banks is never more
than fifty paces wide, often not twenty, and in some parts the barren
rocks extend to the river. We met, this morning, another troop of a
cavalry regiment, returning by the desert from Khartoun. We shall,
no doubt, meet traces of their passage,—dead camels, if not
men. Some of their animals could scarcely crawl, and one of them
dropped on the ground unable to proceed any farther. The master,
a Turk, seemed very much concerned; but whether for the value of
the beast, or real attachment to his fellow traveller, I will not
decide; yet, in justice to his humanity, I must relate, that, when
the Arabs wished to stab and cut it up for food, he refused his
consent. Finding, however, that it was impossible the animal could
proceed, or even live many hours, he ordered his servant to shoot it
with his musket. This showed some feeling; for had he left it to die
on the road, the Arabs would have killed it with their knives, and
then could lawfully have eaten it. They were very much disappointed
at being deprived of their repast, and considered it quite a waste
of valuable food. We have passed the village and temple of Dandour
(on the other bank), and are now encamped opposite the temple and
village of Dacker.[4] Adjoining is a Roman inclosure of large extent
with towers, constructed of unburnt bricks. There are no traces of a
temple within the inclosure; but contiguous to the south-east corner
are some fragments of a room still adorned with hieroglyphics and
sculpture, but too much defaced for us to discover the subject. The
style is very wretched, and evidently Roman. Mountains of hornblende
and sandstone.

_Wady el Elayat.—Feb._ 13. We quitted Dacker this morning, soon
after sunrise, and have encamped this evening in a small valley near
the river, and, as is generally the custom of the caravans, close to
a village. There is not much provision to be procured from a Nubian
village, frequently not even eggs and fowls. A half-starved sheep
or kid may sometimes be purchased, but at a much higher price than
in Upper Egypt. Yet there is no uniformity in the rates: you have a
sheep one day for six piastres; and the next, perhaps at only thirty
miles’ distance off, you must pay twelve, or even more, for one
not larger. This arises, of course, from the poverty of the land,
and the very little communication which exists between the different
villages. My servants and camel-drivers like to chat with the women;
and, perhaps, near the villages we are less annoyed by the wolves
than we might be at a greater distance, the dogs of the peasants
affording a certain protection, though I have often heard them
snuffing around my tent. We have passed this morning the village
of Uffidunia: the temple of that name is on the opposite side of
the river. Our track has chiefly followed the banks of the Nile,
but the views have not been very pleasing. The mountains consist
chiefly of a soft sandstone, the surface of which is very much
darkened by the sun. We have met another troop of the cavalry from
Khartoun. The soldiers have all male or female slaves; some for
their own service, others on speculation for the Cairo market. The
women are almost entirely covered; sometimes I could distinguish
a fine black eye glancing from under the coverings, but it is not
considered decorous to notice them much. This etiquette, which still
prevails so generally in the East, is the same ancient custom by which
Themistocles profited to facilitate his escape to the Persian king. We
are encamped at the borders of the province called Wady el Elayat.

_Sungar.—Feb._ 14. We have been eleven hours in the district of
El Elayat. We left the small village at the commencement of the
Wady this morning at seven, and encamped here at sunset. This is
the last village of the Wady. We have suffered more from fatigue
than before; the road, or rather path, having led for a long time
over the hills. Immediately after starting, we left the valley of
the Nile for an hour and a half. That part of the road was not very
fatiguing. We passed Seboua at eleven, and at two P.M. left the Nile,
and were obliged to alight from our camels and climb the mountain,
for three hours, over the most difficult paths we have yet met
with. A notion prevails in Europe, that camels are incapable of
crossing rough mountainous and stony roads; I can only say that,
upon this rocky, and sometimes steep path, none of our camels fell;
had we used horses, the difficulty would certainly have been as great,
particularly when heavy loads were upon their backs. I would not have
ventured to ride over, even on a mule. The mountains are of sandstone,
some also of hornblende. I sketched, this evening, a native of this
district, my dragoman in the mean time keeping him in conversation
till I finished my sketch, without his having any suspicion what I was
doing. All the Nubians have a superstitious prejudice against having
their portraits drawn. I made some enquiries about the village,
its name, the number of houses, and of inhabitants, &c. The poor
peasants imagined I was employed by the Pasha to take an account
of the country. Apprehensive that I should cause their taxes to be
raised, they gave me a lamentable description of their poverty, saying
that there were indeed eleven houses, but they were all tumbling to
pieces; that they were miserably poor; had scarcely a rag to cover
them; that their land did produce some little cotton and barley,
but if I caused their taxes to be increased, they could not subsist,
but must absolutely die of starvation. Man here may be said only to
vegetate. He drags on, from day to day, a miserable existence, living
on the coarsest food, and ignorant of any comfort. In examining,
however, more closely, we find the peasants of Nubia possessing
some great advantages over those of Lower and Upper Egypt. Their
domestic comfort is decidedly greater. Their women, unlike those
of Egypt, have always their faces uncovered, and enjoy in other
respects much freedom; while that depravity as regards both sexes,
which pervades the whole land of Egypt, is almost utterly unknown in
these Nubian villages. They are also less oppressed; and, thanks to
the poverty of their country, less annoyed by the presence of their
rulers. Their predominant vice is drinking immoderately of bouza and
arracki. There being only three mosques from the first to the second
cataract, a distance of more than 220 miles, and their almost total
deficiency of religious instruction, are perhaps some excuse for
their violating, in this respect, so openly, and to such an excess,
the precepts of the Koran.

_Korosko.—Feb._ 15. We arrived at this village at ten o’clock. Here
again commences a Nubian dialect, but different from the Kenous, above
the first cataract. The district of Wady el Elayat, or Wady el Arabi,
which we passed through yesterday, is the division between these two
Nubian tribes. We have allowed our camels to rest this afternoon,
previous to commencing to-morrow morning the fatigues, perils, and
privations of the Great Desert: they are making the last hearty meal
which they will enjoy for some time; the Ababdes are filling the water
skins, while my servants are employed in foraging for provisions; no
easy task in a Nubian village. Mr. B. has made me a view in colours
of the extraordinary effect of the scenery in Nubia, produced by
the wonderful contrast between the dark hills and the bright yellow
sands, fringed with strips of the beautiful verdure on the banks of
the river. The Governor, an Effendi, paid me a visit in my tent,
and frankly asked me for several things which he saw, and fancied;
which I as frankly refused. The visits of inferior Turks are always
annoyances: it is very seldom that any information can be obtained
from them, and their impertinence is without bounds. I was amused
by his secretary, a Copt, who complained that he was affected by a
pain in his chest when the weather was cold. I gave him some flannel,
which I could ill spare, also some medicine; and, with other advice,
I told him most peremptorily that he must drink no arracki (spirit).
This last injunction disconcerted him exceedingly; and his master
laughed heartily at an advice which he knew to be so unwelcome to his
jovial secretary. I told him it would kill him. “Well,” said he, “if
it kills me, _maktoob min Allah!_ it is written, but drink I must.”
In the evening, he came to me again, half intoxicated. As I offered
him no beverage, except coffee, he soon, with a cunning smile and an
expressive nod, pulled out of his pocket a small bottle of excellent
arracki and a little cup. I did not wish to offend the fellow, having
occasion to leave some boxes in his charge until my return, and
therefore endured his company for some time. At last, his intoxication
increasing, he was quite insupportable, and I was obliged to desire
my servant to turn him out. His good-humour did not forsake him, nor
did he seem at all offended; coolly observing, that he was sorry I was
tired of his company.

_The Great Nubian Desert.—Feb._ 16. This morning, at eight
o’clock, we left Korosko, and entered the Desert. Having omitted
until now giving a description of my caravan, I may mention, as
useful to future travellers, the provisions and equipments which may
be considered as necessary for a journey of this description. Both
my artist, Signor B. and myself, wear the Turkish Nizam uniform. A
traveller might, without much risk, retain his European dress;
but it is most prudent and desirable to adopt the Turkish, as
being the best suited, not only to the climate, but also to serve
the important object of commanding respect. Those travellers who
refuse this tribute to the customs of the country pay dear for
their prejudice. If it does not expose them to frequent insult,
they are at all events less esteemed by the natives; and they lose a
decided advantage, in not having the comfort and luxury of a dress
so admirably suited to the climate and manners of the East. Our
unnatural tight trousers, waistcoats, and coats, with their padding,
braces, straps, starch, stiffners, and stocks, in a tropical country
would be intolerable. Another advantage of this comfortable and
graceful costume is, that it enables you to repose with ease in any
position. To sit bolt upright, on a hard chair, in such a latitude as
this, is what no one could endure, who had experienced the luxurious
ease of the Turkish divan. The rest of my caravan consisted of a guide
(Habeer) on his dromedary; a very picturesque-looking fellow. Besides
the usual arms of the Arabs, the long spear, sword, and shield of the
hippopotamus, he had also a brace of pistols attached to his saddle,
which he took great pride in displaying. He was very independent,
and conscious of the importance of his office, so that I was afraid
at starting he would not have been so manageable as I afterwards
found him. My dragoman, Mahomet Abdini, a native of Cairo, was
the cleverest servant I ever knew in any country: his wily tongue
and insinuating address were often of more service to me than my
piastres. I had, besides, a Greek servant, named Ibrahim, alias
Michele; a Mahometan with the Arabs and Turks, and a Christian with
his own countrymen. He speaks Italian fluently, and also the Turkish,
Greek, and Arabic. He is the musician of the party; and his singing,
accompanied by his fiddle, is vastly agreeable to the natives, but,
being in the harsh style of the modern Greeks, is grating to my
ears. I had, besides, a Copt, who had served me long and usefully
at Thebes, in the dignified station of umbrella-bearer. Including,
therefore, our Ababdes, owners of the camels, the full complement
of my little caravan amounts to twelve persons and eleven camels. My
stock of provisions chiefly consists of a large sack of Cairo biscuit,
and another of rice. Besides these two chief requisites, and also
charcoal, I have a good supply of groceries, tea, sugar, coffee,
and wax candles, and last, but most important, twenty geerbahs of
water, which I expect will be amply sufficient for the eight days of
desert journey, though the Signor has forewarned me, most anxiously,
more than fifty times, _che beve molto_. This is the desert in which
Bruce and Burckhardt suffered so much. They took the easterly and more
direct track, which commences at Deroueh, a little below Assuan, and
therefore had a longer space to traverse, with, however, the advantage
of meeting repeatedly with good water. At a quarter past six, P.M.,
we encamped. Our road this day has been through a succession of
narrow valleys, called Akaba, or mountain passes, and small plains,
bounded by low picturesque hills. The valleys are covered with
sand, in some places two feet deep, but generally much less, and
sometimes the bare rock is visible. Sandstone forms the base of the
valley and of the hills. There are, however, some of slate, varying
from 150 to 180 feet in height. I observed a great variety in their
forms. We have already met with a few of the horrors of the desert,
particularly numbers of dead camels, some of which had perished
lately, and vultures were feeding on their carcases. They seem also
to have attracted the hyænas from their dens, as I discerned on
the sand numerous traces of those animals. Some of our water-skins,
I am sorry to find, are bad. I marvel Signor B. did not perceive
this at Korosko, as he took an active part in tying them up. The
journey from Assuan has injured them, yet, with care, I hope to have
a sufficient supply. This evening the camel men objected to pitching
my tent, saying that they were afraid of robbers. I did not yield to
their alarms, as sleeping in the open air is an Eastern custom which
I am not much inclined to try at this season of the year. I cannot
conceive a tent to be much additional attraction to Arab plunderers,
if there are any; but the depredations upon the water, I fear, are
by my own Ababdes, as their own supply is small. I have, therefore,
caused all the geerbahs to be carried into my tent. If we run short,
and have to suffer, it shall not be for want of precautions. While
my camel men were thus occupied, one of them asked me why I was
subjecting myself to the danger and fatigue of such a journey,
when I was rich enough to stay at home. The Arabs are now not so
much surprised at travellers going to Wady Halfah. So many make that
journey, that it is no longer a novelty; besides that, the Cangias
(boats of the Nile), though any thing but agreeable to Europeans,
appear luxurious to the peasants. They can easily conceive the
pleasure of sailing in what they consider delightful conveyances,
listening to the songs of the boatmen, smoking all the day, and
eating and drinking of the best the villages can afford; but that
travellers should voluntarily expose themselves to the fatigues and
heat of the desert, apparently for the sake of a few old stones,
is to them quite incomprehensible.

_Desert.—Feb._ 17. A fearful accident has befallen us. To our utter
dismay, four of our largest geerbahs are empty, the water having
leaked out during the night. The skins are old, although the best
we could procure at Assuan. The rest seem good: Heaven grant that
they may prove so! the consequences of another such accident might be
fatal. We have passed to-day the bodies of seven human beings who have
doubtless recently perished from thirst and fatigue; we have seen also
dead camels without number. We have travelled twelve hours through
valleys of the same character as those we passed yesterday. Some of
the hills might be from 230 to 250 feet in height, but the greater
number from 100 to 150 feet. Many, like those of yesterday, are
isolated, and some standing in the centre of the valleys. They consist
chiefly of slate, but some are of sandstone. They are called Hojab el
Jenous, from there being several representations of buffaloes drawn
on the rocks by some rude artists, probably Arabs. The valleys are
almost entirely covered with sand, on which I found many round balls,
of the form of peaches, of iron glance. At sunset we left the valleys,
the last hills of which are rather higher than the others, and are
called Bab el Korosko, or the Gate of Korosko, and encamped behind
a small hill, at the commencement of a large sandy plain, called
Atmoor Bahr Bela Ma, that is, the sea without water. We have been
twenty-two hours _en route_ in these valleys, which I consider not
less than sixty miles, from the rate we have travelled. The Ababdes
occasionally sing to animate their camels. The effect in accelerating
their speed is quite extraordinary. First one camel-driver sings a
verse, then the others answer in chorus. It reminded me somewhat
of the Venetian gondoliers.[5] I noticed that they lingered near
the bodies of the dead camels, being apparently more affected by
them than by those of the slaves. The latter they perhaps knew not,
while the camels were old acquaintances. I have often made attempts
to learn the age which this animal usually attains, but have never
been able fully to ascertain it. The general answer is, a hundred
years. By examining and tracing the traditionary stories on the
subject, I am led to conceive their span of life equal to that of
man, and subject to similar frequent contingencies from different
causes, such as extremes of heat and cold, excessive fatigue,
and particularly the great neglect of the owners. This evening I
have bestowed great pains on the preservation of the water, having
suspended the suspicious geerbahs in my tent.

_Feb._ 18. We mounted our camels this morning at half past six, and
have had an exceedingly fatiguing ride of thirteen hours, forty miles,
without any repose, struggling through one immense down of sand. There
were some small hills of sandstone, with occasional thin layers of
gypsum. The sand was very fatiguing for the camels: on its surface
I found disseminated many of the round balls of iron flint, or iron
glance, varying from four to eight inches in circumference. Their
exterior is often uneven. I found, also, some balls, hollow like the
others, and occasionally two united together. These were silicious
conglomerates. I observed, also, numerous quartzose pebbles, and
some fragments of white marble, the only specimens I have seen in
this desert. The mountains are chiefly of slate. We have suffered
very much from the fatigue of this day’s journey, and have still
five days’ march through this waterless desert. The only object
to interest me, and relieve the weariness of mind and body, has
been the merage, so often described. Some travellers state that
this phenomenon has deceived them repeatedly. This I am surprised
at, since its peculiar appearance, joined to its occurrence in
a desert where the traveller is too forcibly impressed with the
recollection that no lakes or standing pools exist, would appear
to me to prevent the possibility, that he who has once seen it can
be a second time deceived. Still this does not diminish the beauty
of the phenomenon:—to see amidst burning sands and barren hills
an apparently beautiful lake, perfectly calm, and unruffled by any
breeze, reflecting in its bosom the surrounding rocks, is, indeed,
an interesting and wonderful spectacle; but it is a tantalising
sight to the Arabs traversing the desert on foot, always with a
scanty supply of water, and often, owing to their great imprudence,
wholly destitute of it. There is much of the sublime to elevate,
and of real danger to excite the mind, in the passage of the Desert:
the boundless plains of sand, the thought of the distance from the
habitations of man, and from the most common necessaries of life, the
perpetual apprehension of falling short of water, and the certainty,
that whoever, from fatigue or illness, is unable to keep pace with the
caravan, will at once, with a camel and his share of the provision,
be abandoned to his fate. And what a fate! Few left in this manner
ever reach their destination. My Ababdes seem, also, to have a great
fear of the Bishareen, who occasionally plunder the caravans. These
alarms produce a certain excitement, which calls forth all the energy
of the traveller: but were these dangers tenfold greater than they
really are, the thought that I am approaching nearer and nearer to
Meroe would sufficiently animate my courage.

_Feb._ 19. We mounted our camels this morning at six, and at eleven
we left the Bahr Bela Ma, which we had been eighteen hours in crossing
(fifty-four miles). Our road began to wind amongst the mountains. The
first valley we passed was of considerable breadth, and contained
great numbers of doom and acacia trees. The former were not very
large, bearing no fruit, and apparently drooping for want of water. In
this valley, which is called Dilet el Doom, or Valley of the Shade
of the Dooms, I observed traces of torrents. Three hours to the east
of it, I am informed that there are appearances of exhausted gold
mines, of the habitations of the miners, and the stones used by them
in procuring the precious metal. The Arabs informed me that the rain
falls here chiefly at the rising of the Nile, but that last year there
was none, otherwise we should have seen herbage on the hills;—that
twenty-four hours is sufficient to produce it. This valley has the
appearance of having once been cultivated; but I could discover no
remaining trace of habitations. They tell me that the Bishareen,
when there is pasture on the hills, lead here their flocks, and
pitch their tents in this pretty valley. Perhaps, when Ethiopia
was more populous, and before the gold mines were exhausted, this
road was much frequented; and probably, by sinking wells (for I feel
persuaded that water might be found in these valleys), and by forming
small colonies at suitable stations, a safe and rapid communication
may have existed between the centre and extremity of the kingdom. A
short distance out of the direct road is a well called Omrisha,
now dry, but which contains water during the rainy season. About
an hour and a half beyond this is another well, called Sufir, now
also dry. The mountains consist generally of flinty slate, some
few of sandstone. Their forms are broken, and very picturesque. At
two o’clock we passed through a chain of hills, by a road which
has evidently been artificially formed. This is another proof that
pains have been taken by a more civilised people to diminish the
difficulties of travelling in this region. At four P.M. we entered
the valley of the spring called El Murrah, or the Well of Bitter
Waters, the only one in the Desert that is not now dry; we encamped
for the night, that our camels might have time to drink, and our
men to repose. On one of the rocks of the valley of the spring are
some hieroglyphics. I distinguished the name of the god Horus, and
the hawk, the emblem of that divinity. There are four wells within
a few feet of each other, all exceedingly salt, and considered by
the Arab merchants and Turks as very unwholesome. One, however,
is much better than the others. The Arabs and camels drink of this,
and we have filled some of our water-skins, in case the stock from
the Nile should not be sufficient; otherwise we shall not use it,
as it is extremely salt, and strongly impregnated with iron. One
of my servants, not content with his allowance of the water of
the Nile, drank a large cup of it, which caused nausea and severe
purging for some time afterwards. It has not the same effect on the
Ababdes, who apparently enjoy it as much as their camels. There are
six families of Bishareen stationed here, who attend to cleaning the
wells from sand. The Pasha placed them in this valley, but gives them
no allowance. They possess camels, with which they trade, and supply
the merchants who need these animals. All the caravans give them a
trifle. They live in tents made of mats; and their wild appearance,
extraordinary head-dress, yet fine features, quite accord with our
idea of dwellers in the desert. The nauseous salt water is their only
beverage, but does not seem to disagree with them. I never beheld a
more sad picture of savagery and desolation than their encampment. The
Arab tribes, even the most remote, cannot be called savages, since
they speak one of the richest and most beautiful languages in the
world, and many of them are versed in the Koran; but the harsh and
uncouth gibberish of these wild Bishareen is only intelligible to
themselves. They inhabit tracts of country, where Nature seems almost
to deny them a subsistence; and not even the terror of the Pasha’s
vengeance can restrain their predatory propensities. A European
must have powerful protection from their own chiefs to venture into
their inhospitable wilds. The traveller who has little of novelty to
interest his attention in the dreary desert cannot readily dispel
the gloomy impression forced on his mind by contemplating man in
this his lowest condition. When he reflects on the abject state of
these naked Bishareen, their ignorance of religious principles, of all
intellectual and civilised enjoyments, the scanty and precarious means
by which their life is supported: a dish of coarse unground dourah,
moistened by water of the most disgusting quality; a miserable tent
their only shelter from the tropical sun, and from the nightly cold,
so bitter in these regions, and so painful from its contrast with
the mid-day heat: he is astonished at the physical phenomenon, that
the constitution of man can endure so much privation; and he cannot
but admire the mysteries of Providence, when he sees a human being
of like capacities and passions with himself content and happy in
a state so slightly removed from the condition of the brute.

_Feb._ 20. This morning, at six, we left the Bishareen quite in
joyance at having received a trifle more than the customary gift of
a few piasters, and delighted with the privilege of scrambling for a
few pieces of broken glass, which had been thrown out of my tent. I
should state that last night, and also for two hours before we set out
this morning, they had stationed themselves close to our encampment,
like wild animals seeking their prey. Three quarters of an hour after
our departure from the well, we left the mountains, and our road
then lay over an immense plain of sand, sometimes very difficult
for the camels to wade through, but generally not very soft, and
indeed, occasionally quite hard. This plain, which is ten hours, or
thirty miles, in extent, is almost entirely surrounded by hills. The
width varies from about ten to fifteen miles. At five P.M. we again
entered into the mountains, and waded through several narrow valleys,
containing acacia trees. At six, that is, after twelve hours’ ride,
we encamped. The mountains, called Cab el Kofas, or the Spilling of
the baskets, particularly one about 400 feet high, at the entrance of
this chain, are very picturesque. The effect of a tropical sunset upon
them was magnificent. Their general height was about 200 feet, and
some were of less altitude. Their form was generally a long continuous
chain, with peaks of various forms. I observed some in the distance
totally isolated, and having the appearance of pyramids. We should
not have passed this plain so rapidly but for the common custom of
the Arabs, before mentioned, of urging on their camels by singing:
the effect is very extraordinary; this musical excitement increases
their pace at least one fourth. I often asked the camel drivers to
sing, not only to hasten our progress, but also for the pleasure of
hearing their simple melodies. Some of their best songs possess a
plaintive sweetness that is almost as touching as the most exquisite
European airs. The words are often beautiful, generally simple and
natural, being improvisatory effusions. The following is a very
imperfect specimen. One takes up the song:—“Ah, when shall I
see my family again; the rain has fallen, and made a canal between
me and my home. Oh, shall I never see it more?” The reply to this
and similar verses was always made by the chorus, in words such as
these:—“Oh, what pleasure, what delight, to see my family again;
when I see my father, mother, brothers, sisters, I will hoist a flag
on the head of my camel for joy!” I asked a fine, handsome lad, who
was singing this _ranz des vaches_ of the desert with the feeling of
a Swiss, if he would go with me to England, to my village. He asked
me how long I had been absent; I told him three years. “No,”
said he, “I cannot go with you; if I were to be absent from my
family three years, I should be very unhappy—I should be ill.”
Near the place where we are encamped is another well, now dry.

_Feb._ 21. We set out this morning at seven, and proceeded through
defiles in the mountains, which at eleven we quitted. The valleys we
passed through, for the first four hours, were strewed with quartz,
a common kind of porphyry, and fragments of indurated clay slate,
approaching to rubbarid jasper. The mountains were chiefly of flinty
slate and hornblende. There are a few acacia trees in the valley, and
here and there dried up grass. Among the latter we started a gazelle,
which Mr. B. and I pursued round an isolated hill at the entrance of
a large plain. We could scarcely have lost ourselves, particularly as
I had a compass in my pocket; but, on our rejoining the caravan, the
Habeer warned us not to leave it again, and told us many instances
of Turks and others having been lost by following the gazelles
into the mountains. A Nazr and Katshef perished, very recently,
by their imprudent eagerness in chasing the animals through their
winding valleys. Some time afterwards, a particular search having
been made, they were found dead a considerable distance from the
road, their hands clenched, apparently in the last agonies of that
most horrid of deaths, which is produced by thirst. This creature
might have been fancied our evil genius in the guise of a gazelle,
tempting us to destruction; for, scarcely did we come within sight
of the graceful coquette, than she bounded off, and, after a short
career, stopped again.


                    ····“Lasciva puella:

  Et fugit ad salices, et se cupit antè videri.”—_Buc._ iii.


She continued to lead us on in this wanton manner, until we were aware
that we had wandered from the road further than was prudent. At last,
she ran towards some narrow defiles; but we did not allow our ardour
for the chase to carry us further. Although conscious we were in the
direction the caravan must take, we did not see it for some time,
and felt a strange inquietude on finding ourselves alone, destitute,
and helpless, in the midst of this immense desert. I fired my gun,
and, the signal being answered, our uneasiness was relieved. Towards
the end of this chain of hills, about two hours’ journey east of
the direct road, is a place called Absah, where there are traces of
gold mines, and, as at the one at the same distance from the valley of
the dooms, numerous remains of habitations, but apparently not very
ancient. The stones with which they were worked remain, and there
are wells now dry. The Arabs keep them a great secret, and will take
no traveller to visit them, unless he has a particular order from
the Pasha, and is protected by one of their chiefs. M. Bonomi, who
enjoyed these advantages, will, I hope, soon give us an account of
them. The result, I believe, of his investigation was, that they are
now so exhausted, that they would not repay the labour of working. At
eleven we entered a large sandy plain, and at four P.M. we passed some
hills of a pyramidal shape. They are of syenite, and their formation
is similar to the round granite rocks of the First Cataract. They are
called El Talati Greibat—the Three Greibat—from their being at a
distance apparently only three. They extend considerably towards the
east; but some of them are so low as to be nearly covered with the
sand. North-east of these I observed some hills of the same conical
form, called Adaramat; but I was at too great a distance from them to
perceive whether they were of granite. After eleven hours’ ride,
we encamped in the plain at six. The wind is very high; I am almost
afraid of my tent being carried away. For several days I have been on
the look out, thinking it possible that on these light sandy plains
I might see some of Bruce’s pillars of moving sand; but I have
not been favoured with the view of any such _stalking_ prodigy;
and I must declare that, notwithstanding the numerous deserts
I have crossed, at different seasons, always making particular
enquiries on the subject, I have neither seen nor heard of such
as he describes. The wandering Arabs tell the women, children,
and peasants of the Nile fearful stories of the whirlpool of the
desert, and the terrible simoom; but such tales, embellished by an
Oriental imagination, will rarely bear investigation. From what I
have been able to ascertain, there are certain gusts of wind which
occasionally sweep over these deserts, with clouds of sand, which
prevent your distinguishing any object at all distant; but these are
not very dangerous to caravans, except in those tracts where there
are immense hills or accumulations of light sand, such as I have seen
near the Oasis Magna, in the Libyan desert. The custom of caravans,
when they have the misfortune to meet with such blasts, is to pitch
their tents and shelter themselves within them. Whatever may be the
quantity of sand, they are always safe if they can reach the summit,
or place themselves under covert of a hill. I will mention here an
instance of this kind, which, in returning from my first voyage up
the Nile to the Second Cataract, along with Mr. Ponsonby, he and I
witnessed, on the 14th of April, 1832. We were on the point of going
that evening to the Isle of Elephantina, when a violent storm, which,
considering the season, though rather too early, I might almost
call Khampseen, came on. The whole day had been unusually hazy,
the air thick and exceedingly oppressive. The extreme heat of the
thermometer was 86° in the shade; at sunrise, 70°; sunset, 74°:
86° was a few degrees higher than we experienced it several days
previous and after; and I may also remark, that the day following,
the thermometer did not rise above 79°. About five o’clock, an
immense cloud of sand came sweeping along with a wind so violent,
that a boat which was crossing the river to the island was driven
back, and the air became so turbid and impregnated with sand, that
it was impossible to distinguish any object ten yards from the bank
of the river. We heard the peasants in the fields, seemingly wild
with confusion and alarm, calling aloud to each other and for their
children; and when the sand enveloped them from our sight, we still
heard their cries. A scene so strange and impressive I shall never
forget. The gale blew almost directly from the west, and seemed to
be a specimen of those which have successively swept before them
the hills of light loose sand, which, as the Egyptian traveller
will recollect, have completely smothered the cultivated land on
the western bank of the river opposite Assuan. We endeavoured to
shelter ourselves from it as well as the old windows of our cangia
would permit; but the sand penetrated every where, into my bed,
arms, instruments, and linen; and even my watch was affected. I
felt it in my eyes and between my teeth. I then made the reflection,
how awful it would be to encounter such a simoom in the desert. It
was by such a storm that the army of Cambyses is supposed to have
been overwhelmed, as Dr. Darwin in his “Botanic Garden” most
graphically describes it:—


  Wave over wave the driving desert swims,

  Bursts o’er their heads, inhumes their struggling limbs,

  And one great earthly ocean covers all:

  Then ceased the storm—Night bow’d his Æthiop brow

  To earth, and listen’d to the groans below.

                          ······Awhile the living hill

  Heaved with convulsive throes, and all was still.[6]


In mentioning that I have never heard of nor seen these sandy or
meteoric pillars, which is the more remarkable since Bruce says
he observed them day after day, I do not mean to affirm that he
could not have seen that extraordinary phenomenon in this very
desert. That adventurous and intrepid traveller has been already
too much calumniated. I merely state that my own experience, and
the numerous enquiries I have made, lead to the conclusion, that
such phenomena are now unknown: it must, however, be recollected,
that Bruce crossed this desert more in the interior. Those who have
most strongly condemned Bruce for his occasional exaggerations and
embellishments (into which he certainly fell), have forgotten that
few other travellers have ever brought to their country so large a
mass of fresh, interesting, valuable, and correct information. Salt,
his most severe critic, in speaking of his drawings of the ruins of
Axum, asserts that he was no draftsman; yet he contradicts himself
in a variety of other instances, where he confirms the accuracy of
Bruce’s delineations of plants and birds, which are more difficult
to execute than an obelisk without hieroglyphics. Mr. B. is most to
blame for not acknowledging sufficiently the services of his Italian
artist. Many of his tales, marvellous as they at first appeared,
have proved to be correct. There was a time in England, when, if
a traveller mentioned any fact that was contrary to preconceived
ideas, he was accused of error, and often, notwithstanding his
previous character of honour and integrity, of wilful exaggeration,
and even misrepresentation. Now, however, the mass of well-educated
and scientific men have more liberal ideas, and, being anxious for
information, are pleased to see the errors of earlier travellers
corrected, and endeavour, with philosophical discrimination, to
bestow on each the credit which is due to him.

_Feb._ 22. My dromedary was on his knees at seven this morning. The
Arab mounts his camel, by pulling down his head, placing his knee on
its neck, and allowing the animal to raise him on its back. The first
time I attempted to ascend a dromedary in this style, was on my route
from the Oasis Magna; and I paid the penalty of my inexperience. I
had pushed on in advance of my caravan nearly a couple of miles,
when I had occasion to alight to adjust my saddle. Not doubting that
I could mount with true Arab agility, I made the attempt; but deeming
it necessary to spring with the return of the animal’s neck, our
united force pitched me clear over its tail, leaving me sprawling on
the sand,—a lesson to all too aspiring riders. The dromedary ran
back at full speed to the caravan. For eleven hours before reaching
any hills, except a small one called Faroot, we traversed an immense
down, the full extent of which, from the hills called El Talati
Greibat, to the smaller ones called Mogram, could not be less than
forty miles, without any perceptible alteration in its level. It
consists of sand, on which was disseminated a great variety of
quartz fragments, principally of a deep red colour, and from a half
to three inches in length. I observed, also, on the plain, numerous
detached pieces of mica, and some curious specimens of granite. We
passed at six P.M. the small range of mountains called Mogram, which
are of flinty slate; and about two hours afterwards we encamped,
after thirteen hours’ ride, in another plain. To-morrow morning we
expect to arrive at the valley of the Nile. I look forward to that
event with great pleasure. My servants are exhausted by the bodily
fatigue for so many hours each day, the short allowance of water,
the cold at night, sleeping in the open air, and other privations
which they are obliged to submit to; and Signor B. begins to bear
with impatience the want of his soup, the provident regulations of
the desert not permitting our precious water to be employed for that
purpose. For two days the wind has been high, and we have not been
able to use our umbrellas as a protection from the scorching rays
of an almost vertical sun. Our camels, also, have suffered from
the thirteen days’ fatigue. We were obliged to leave one at El
Murrah with the Bishareen, being unable to continue the journey. I
observed, also, this afternoon, that my Ababdes seemed more than
usually tired. Their manner of resting is peculiar. They walk on a
short distance in advance of the caravan, choose a flat part of the
desert, if possible, shaded by a rock, and extend themselves at full
length flat on their backs, stretching out their arms and legs. This
mode of reposing for a few minutes I have found to be very refreshing.

_Arrival at the Nile. Village of Abouhammed.—Feb._ 23. We left
this morning at seven, and reached the banks of the Nile in five
hours. There is no apparent descent from the desert. Our fatigues
and sufferings were all forgotten, and every one seemed to bless
his stars, and think it luxury to quaff again the delicious waters
of this most noble of streams, uncontaminated by the taste of the
geerbah skins, and no longer confined to the scanty allowance of
the caravan. The Ababdes have found here many relations and friends,
and there seems to be no end to salamats and taip eens, to shaking
of hands and embracing. At their request I have consented that the
remainder of the day shall be devoted to repose and festivity. My
servants have killed the fattest sheep they could find; part of
which, and a small backsheesh (present of money), I have given to
the Ababdes to complete their happiness. They are already at work,
drinking the bouza; and I observe that some pretty Berber women with
their jests and charms are increasing their hilarity. We have been
eighty-six hours in this route:—

                                                                  Miles.

  33 hours in the valleys, at 2¾ miles per hour                    91¾

  53 hours on the plains, which I calculate at 3 miles
  per hour                                                        159
                                                                  ----
  This agrees very satisfactorily with the known
  difference of latitude.[7] (See the Map.)                       250
                                                                  ----

This part of the valley of the Nile is not very pleasing or fertile,
the eastern bank being almost entirely swallowed by the desert. The
village is called Abou-Hammed; and consists of a few houses, or rather
wretched huts, built of mud and straw. The fortified house of Sheakh
Halif is almost as large as the village itself: since his death it
has not been occupied. It consists of a large quadrangular brick
enclosure, with a circular tower at each corner. In the centre is
a building of one story, in which are the divans and sleeping-room
of the Sheakh. Along the enclosing walls are innumerable little
huts,—the apartments of his wives and concubines, the latter of whom
are said to have at one time amounted to no fewer than sixty. Opposite
to this village is the Island of Mograt, which is principally
remarkable for numerous fine doum trees, profusely scattered upon
it. The Sheakh of this district paid me a visit, and informed me that
it contained, chiefly residing on the island, twenty-five families;
which, he said, probably consisted of 300 individuals. I remarked,
that this was allowing a very great proportion for each family;
but he replied, that one family consists sometimes of forty persons;
a fact only to be accounted for by the polygamic privileges of the
Mahometans. I am told that the district contains forty sakkeas,
which confirms this estimate of the population, as seven or eight
persons may always be reckoned to a wheel. The peasants of the island
informed me that they pay twelve dollars and two ardebs of wheat
as a tax for each sakkea. I searched over the eastern side of this
island for antiquities; but without success, except a small fragment
of a wall of unburnt bricks, apparently Saracenic. I neither found nor
heard of any vestiges of its ancient rulers. The island is very rocky;
I observed some of hornblende slate, and granite, with disseminated
fragments of quartz, and beautiful specimens of Egyptian jasper. The
Sheakh complained of its being rocky and not very fertile: “We toil
hard,” said he, “but earn little:” yet this part of the valley
of the Nile seems very healthy. The malaria which, higher up, after
the time of the inundation, causes so much sickness and mortality,
is here unknown. The tropical rains sometimes extend lower than this
place, but not regularly: for three years rain has been entirely
wanting, and the peasants complain of not having herbage in the
valleys for their camels. I crossed the river to the Island of
Mograt, on a raft or boat of the rudest description,—three logs
of wood lashed together, with sides and square ends constructed
in the same primitive manner. Perceiving that the natives passed
in these safely, I did not hesitate to trust myself upon one. A
peasant, with a clumsily constructed paddle, impelled and guided
the raft; another holding up with one hand part of his dress, as a
protection against the wind, while with the other he was employed
in baling out the water. The servant I had with me was similarly
engaged. Before we entered the raft it was one third full of water,
which was immediately doubled by our additional weight. I did not,
however, allow them to bale out much, as I perceived there was less
danger of our being swamped than upset by the violence of the wind,
and was therefore glad of the water for ballast. I sat at one end,
not uselessly employed; for, as the raft seemed often inclined to
turn over on one side or the other alternately, I kept it balanced by
throwing my weight accordingly. I asked my Charon if they were often
upset? “Yes,” said he, “repeatedly; but we are unembarrassed
with clothes, and can swim to shore;” at the same time eyeing rather
superciliously my wide Turkish trousers, which, had any accident
occurred, would as infallibly have carried me to the bottom as if a
millstone had been tied around my neck. In fact, my worthy friend,
Charon, on his return to the island, after bringing me back, was
upset, and saved his life by his dexterity in swimming. I scarcely
had time to smoke a shibouk, when my servant came running in to give
me this intelligence, and congratulate me on my escape; but as these
Arabs, like crocodiles, swim nearly as easily as they walk, no danger
was apprehended. I observed to-day the curious manner they transport
the camels to the island. The men fill a large geerbah (water-skin),
with air, on which they place themselves, and paddle across, leading
the animals by a cord, and encouraging them to swim by their songs.

_Gagi.—Feb._ 24. We set out this morning at eight, and encamped
at the village of Gagi at five,—nine hours. Here, and in the
island of the same name adjoining, they number fifty men, all
of the Ababde tribe. In the island are six sakkeas, for each of
which they pay to the government fourteen dollars and two ardebs of
wheat. We are encamped, as usual, near the house of the sheakh. I
walked into his harem without ceremony, and chatted with his wives
and female slaves. Some of them were very beautifully formed;
and being almost naked, they displayed finely shaped busts, and,
I may say, almost perfect symmetry of shape; their features very
regular, and their full dark eyes exceedingly expressive. The little
drapery worn by them is adjusted with great taste, and they possess
a natural ease of manner, neither bashful nor yet too forward, which
is very engaging. The slaves were employed in making basket-work,
and the wives reposing on their angareebs. I could not, in Egypt,
have taken the liberty of entering a harem in this manner; but here,
apparently, more freedom is permitted, for they did not seem at all
offended; on the contrary, they gave me as much encouragement as I
could desire. They examined my arms and dress, and were profuse in
their admiration of my beard, and in exclamations, as, “Odjaib,
whallah! wonderful, God is great! but he is a tall man.” The sheakh
was smoking under the shade of some doum trees. He saw me enter,
but had the politeness not to interfere. The title of sheakh was at
one time always hereditary in Upper Egypt; but the Pasha, in most
instances, put an end to this mode of transmission; choosing for that
honour those that had best suited his purposes. In Upper Nubia, he has
respected a little more the existing distinctions. There the office
of sheakh is still in general hereditary: the eldest son succeeds to
the father; and, in default of male issue, the eldest daughter enjoys
the dignity. On account of the number of their wives, it rarely occurs
that they have no son; but I am told there is an instance now, near
Dongolah, of a female sheakh. I have described the fortified house
of a great sheakh: that of one less powerful and wealthy consists,
generally, of two large rooms, a divan and harem, between which is
a pallisaded enclosure, where the flocks are kept. (See Vignette,
p. 1.) The sheakhs offer us every night angoureebs[8] (bedsteads)
made of wood and cords, but we are now so accustomed to sleeping on
the ground that we no longer feel it a hardship. On this evening, and
also that of yesterday, we have been annoyed by swarms of very small
flies, like midges, which draw blood most copiously from our hands,
but without leaving much painful irritation.[9] From Abou-Hammed to
this village our route has always been through the desert, sometimes
300 paces only, but often as much as three miles from the river. The
banks are covered with doums and acacias; the fruit of the former
is very well flavoured, tasting like good gingerbread, but the
rind is very hard, and the little that is eatable is so difficult
to get at, that it is really not worth the trouble. This tree has
rarely, if ever, branches springing up from the root, like the palm
tree. The small round and full yellow flower of the acacias emits a
most delightful odour. The size of these trees is here very great,
compared to those we see in Europe. The first two hours this morning
I noticed porphyry rocks appearing above the sand, and fragments
of the same disseminated; afterwards hornblende rock. Near here the
rocks are of quartz.

_Abou-Hashim.—Feb._ 25. We left Gagi this morning at seven,
and encamped here at half past three P.M.—eight hours and a
half. At half past ten we passed the village of Atmoon, situated
on the opposite side of the river. It is inhabited entirely by
Berbers. There are eleven sakkeas there. I am told that there are
generally seven persons, including children, employed at each. At this
village, and in the Island of Mero opposite, are twenty-three sakkeas,
which pay ten dollars 150 piastres, and four ardebs of dourah each,
equal to 210 piastres. Cailliaud has marked two islands, one Meri,
the other Mero; but there is, in fact, only one, called Mero. The
Island of Kourgos, we slept opposite to last night, extended
until ten A.M. At half past ten we passed an isolated mountain,
three miles on our left. During the greater part of the day we have
passed over sandy flat plains; rocks of coarse granite, hornblende,
and gneiss occasionally appearing above the surface, and fragments
of the same and of quartz being also disseminated. I also remarked
rocks and fragments of sandstone much charged with iron. At twelve
we visited, close to the river, the ruins of a Saracenic castle of
crude, that is, unbaked, bricks. The Arabs, by their description,
had led us to expect antiquities. Our track this day has generally
been a mile and a half distant from the river. (For the bearings,
see the Map.) Shortly before arriving here, we observed fields of
dourah; otherwise the banks of this side of the river are generally
uncultivated, but covered with doum and large acacia trees. The
productive land seems to be in the islands. The inhabitants of this
village are mixed, there being some families of Ababdes, but the
greater number Berbers. We always go to the house of the sheakh,
who meets us with the usual Arab civilities, and gives us his hand,
welcoming us as Mahometans, _Salam Aleycam_, and supplying us with
sheep and milk. Some of these sheakhs have an air and bearing truly
dignified and patriarchal. Their flocks of goats and sheep form
their chief ostensible wealth: the sheep are small, and the wool
worth very little, being so coarse as almost to resemble hair. Their
colour is beautifully variegated, generally white and black, but in
some cases white and brown. The mutton, though too young, is good,
and the goats’ milk the best I ever tasted. We found, near the
river, this morning, numerous shells of the genus Etheria, almost
resembling the Ostrea.[10]

_Feb._ 26. We left Abou-Hashim this morning at seven, and encamped at
five P.M. At half past eleven we passed El Bagahra, and at half past
one Neddi, the former a large, the latter a small, village. We passed
also the small island of Essabeas, where there are four sakkeas;
this island begins at Bagahra, and terminates opposite Neddi. Our
route, all day, has been at a short distance from the river,
over the same kind of downs and plains, covered with the doum and
acacia trees. Near the villages I observed barley and cotton, but no
dourah; the produce of the island, I am informed, is the same. These
villages are entirely inhabited by the Berbers. We have passed
no hills to-day, but I observed continually points of hornblende
slate and coarse granite appearing above the sand. I have also been
surprised to observe to-day, _in the desert_, great numbers of the
same shells. We have passed, during these last three days, several
burying-places of the Arabs. They consist of earthen or sandy mounds,
half a foot high; the length and breadth, of course, depend on the
size of the body. At each end of the mound is a piece of black slate
rock, about a foot high, and along the centre is a narrow gutter,
which is filled with loose little pebbles, and, what is singular,
these are always of the same colour. Sometimes they consist of small
pieces of yellow, and sometimes of white, quartz; and, occasionally,
I observed them of the shells above mentioned. Considerable pains is
evidently taken to choose these stones of exactly the same colour
and description, and also generally of the same dimensions. The
effect is very pleasing. The slabs at each end reminded me of the
simple gravestones in our country churches: the recollection was
interesting; but they could not stand the comparison; for where,
indeed, in the wide world, is there any scene to be compared with
the tranquil beauty of our village churches, diffusing a peaceful
charm over the rural landscape of rich enclosures, snug parsonage,
and baronial demesnes, peculiar to England. Here is but a dreary
wilderness: nature stern and desolate; man nearly in the state of
the savage. In this part of the valley the breadth of the Nile is
generally about one third of a mile; but it varies exceedingly,
being sometimes a whole mile, and occasionally not much above a
quarter. The foliage on its banks renders it not unpleasing to the
eye, particularly as contrasted with the adjoining deserts. The
flatness of the country prevents its being picturesque, except in
some parts, where rocks and little islands in the bed of the river
break the monotony of the landscape. This evening we are encamped,
not, as usual, near a village, but on the banks of the Nile, previous
to passing a small tract of desert.

_Granata.—Feb._ 27. We commenced our sandy route this morning at
half-past six, and my caravan arrived at this village at half-past
six P.M. Mr. B. and myself were only nine hours. Having pushed on our
dromedaries, we crossed the small desert, before the fifth cataract,
in six hours. This desert is sandy, with quartz and flinty slate
disseminated. We saw, for the first time, three wild asses, which
had been browsing among the acacias near the Nile. There are great
numbers of them in the country, but the peasants very seldom succeed
in catching or destroying them. A mixed breed is sometimes seen in
the villages. From the description of the Arabs, I conceive that the
zebra, also, exists in these deserts. The wild ass seems larger than
the common one; but we were at too great a distance to observe them
particularly. The peasants seldom chase them, but with a good horse
it is not very difficult. The reader will recollect the beautiful
and accurate description in Job, chap. xxxix.[11] We arrived at the
fifth cataract at half past twelve, and remained three hours. It is
not to be compared to either the first or second for picturesque
effect. There are here no mountains, or even hills, and the fall,
at a little distance, is scarcely perceptible. The sound is great,
the rapids strong, and of such an extent, that, at this season of the
year, certainly no boat of any size could pass: when the Nile is high
there would be little difficulty. We made two views, looking north and
south, and coloured them on the spot; but the vignette will give the
reader an idea of this cataract of the Nile. Two hours below are the
islands of Kermi, Drogueh, and Melor: almost opposite the cataract
is a village called El Solymanieh. Doums and acacias, as usual,
on the banks of the river. An hour before arriving, we passed the
small village of Gouloulab. This village, where we are encamped,
is very large, and said to contain 300 men. The island of Ertole,
opposite, is represented to have the same population; but this,
I think, is rather an exaggeration of the sheakhs’.

[Illustration: FIFTH CATARACT OF THE NILE.]

_El Makkarif, Capital of the ancient Kingdom, and now Turkish
Province, of Berber.—Feb._ 28. We started this morning at seven,
and at ten passed the large village of El Abadieh, a little below
which, on the opposite side, is Engreyab; at a quarter past twelve,
El Ferrakah, opposite which is Abselam; at half past twelve, El
Dankel; at half past one, El Hassan (vestiges of a Saracenic castle),
opposite which are the villages of Dekseet and Wady Shekeer; at half
past one, the village of El Howe; at half past two, El Gadawab; at
three, we passed a village called Housh, opposite which is Ellet Wady
Gadallah; at a quarter past three, Mahanifa; at half past three, Dich;
and at four entered the capital, Makkarif. Most of these villages
are large, but many almost entirely deserted. In one of 120 houses,
I counted only twenty that were inhabited. This is occasioned, not
only by a decrease of population, but also by the wretched state
of poverty to which the Berbers are now reduced. Many families who
had formerly two, three, and even six houses, are obliged to content
themselves with one, allowing the others to fall into ruin from not
having the means or inducement to repair them. If still possessed of
any wealth, their only means of preserving it, or, at all events,
of transmitting it to their posterity, is to keep it secret; and
by an affectation of poverty, lull any suspicion that may arise of
their possessing treasure. Notwithstanding what I am told of their
hidden wealth, I should suspect the examples to be few: the real
distress is unfortunately far too evident. The houses are scattered,
and often at a considerable distance from each other; never crowded
together, like the cottages in the villages of Egypt. Being shaded
by the graceful doum and acacia trees, they produce a rural and
sometimes picturesque effect. According to the ancient divisions, we
have only been this day in the province of Berber. Since we reached
El Ferrakah, the character of the country has been quite different;
more villages, a richer soil, and even the desert thickly studded
with trees like a shrubbery. The country between Abou-Hammed and
Grenata is included in the Turkish province of Berber, and as such
I have described it. The natives are the Rabatat, once the terror
of caravans. The heavy exactions they imposed on all travellers,
or rather merchants, obliged the latter to take the long route
from Derouey to Makkarif, the same in which Burckhardt and Bruce
suffered so severely. The manners of the Rabatat seemed rougher,
and their depravity more open, than I observe here.

Immediately on our arrival, we paid a visit to Abbas Bey, the
governor of the province. He has a private house for his harem;
but during the day he holds his court and takes his meals in one of
the fortified houses of the sheakhs. At the door we found a number
of soldiers and officers drinking coffee. The Turkish governor is
obliged to furnish the officers attached to his court, as well as
strangers and principal persons of the town who wish it, with as
much of this beverage as they choose to drink; and so great is the
consumption, that it is in fact the most considerable part of his
official expenditure. We were ushered into a large room, forty feet
by twenty, and proportionably high, with windows at one end, but,
as usual, without glass: some small windows, above the larger, were
covered with paper as a substitute. Around the room was a divan one
foot high and four feet wide: one end was covered with mats, over
which were thrown rich carpets and scarlet plush. The Governor,
a man of about thirty, of a stern yet prepossessing appearance,
was seated in the corner upon the skin of a panther. The courtiers
were arranged on each side according to their respective ranks. On
his right was the grand Cadi, in a brown dress, with a green turban
(the badge of his having made the pilgrimage to Mecca, and being a
sheriff, or descendant of Mahomet). He is a native of this country,
and fills the offices of high priest and chief judge. The Bey paid
him great attention; no doubt on account of his great influence
with the people. He has a very jesuitical countenance: I thought
of Alfieri’s celebrated speech in Saul. Next to this priest was
Sheakh Sayd, the Chief of the Ababdes. (See Plate.) His family
have held this title from time immemorial: the stamp of nobility
is marked upon his high forehead; and there is an expression of
dignified mildness in his countenance which commands respect: he
interested me exceedingly. Another, but inferior, Sheakh of the
Ababdes was seated next to Sheakh Sayd, in a blue linen dress. Next
to the Ababde Sheakh was the Melek Nazr ed Deen. This man was
forty years melek or king of this province. I am informed that the
meleks of Shendy and Metammah attacked his kingdom, defeated him,
seized his riches, and sullied the honour of his family. In revenge,
it is said he fled to the Pasha of Egypt, and represented to him
how easily he might subdue the country. The Arabs, and in this
district particularly, extol in the most hyperbolical terms the
merits of their great men. I will mention their expressions in a few
instances as characteristic. According to their extravagant accounts,
the war-cry of this melek was, “I am a bull, the son of a bull,
and will die or conquer!” They assert that he is able to cut a
camel in two with a blow of his sabre, and to eat a whole sheep to
his breakfast. He really is an amazingly stout man for this country
(see Plate I.), and both his appearance and manners are surly and
repulsive, which, however, is not extraordinary, when we consider
that he is now a disregarded pensioner (having merely the rank and
pay of a katsheff), and no real authority in the extensive province
where, at one time, his will was law. Several other personages were
present, among whom were katsheffs, kaymacans, and artillery officers;
Sheakh Beshir (see Plate II.), now melek of Shendy, and some sheakhs
of the Bishareens. In the centre of the room stood about thirty
attendants; cowhasses, with their silver-headed canes, armed with
pistols and sabres; janissaries in the Albanian dress; mamelukes,
Turkish soldiers, sheboukgees, slaves, &c. &c. The Bey was playing
at drafts with Sheakh Sayd when we entered, but immediately closed
the board, and rose from his seat. He received us very courteously,
ordered us pipes and coffee in abundance, and a fresh supply of the
latter at least every half hour; and, contrary to the Egyptian custom,
there came usually two cups for each person at a time. Their manner
of presenting it is in the highest style of Turkish fashion; holding
the bottom of the fingan (cup) between the first finger and thumb,
with the hand curved. It was presented at the same time to the Bey
and myself; then to the others according to their rank. I presented
to him the firman of the Pasha. He looked at the seal, kissed it,
and applied it to his forehead in token of his obedience; but at
the same time assured me that, on account of my being an Englishman,
even if I had brought no firman, he would have done whatever was in
his power to facilitate my plans. He would not allow us to leave
him without partaking of his evening meal, a short description of
which may amuse the reader.

After we had well lathered our hands in the usual Turkish manner,
the round white metal table was brought in, and we all squatted
down on the floor, with due decorum, around it. We had first soup,
and afterwards twenty dishes of meat, one following the other, and
the dinner finished with a pillof of rice. We used wooden spoons for
the soup, diving into the dish promiscuously; the meat we ate with
our fingers, using always the thumb and two forefingers of the right
hand; each person keeping as well as he could to his own angle of the
dish. Holding a piece of bread in his hand, he fished out the pieces
of meat, with a due proportion of gravy. The dishes were all small,
and some of them very _recherchés_; but, as usual, it was mutton,
mutton, nothing but mutton, though disguised in a great variety
of forms, with herbs, beans, and sauces from Cairo. The hands of
the Bey had the precedence in plunging into each dish, and the
paws of the others briskly followed those of their leader. Having
tasted one or two choice morsels, his Excellency nodded his head,
and that plate vanished. A number of hungry attendants who were
to dine upon the remains of the feast, waited in a string, and
handed the dishes back and forward, from one to the other, with the
greatest rapidity. Very little was said during the repast; indeed,
whoever is so foolish as to converse on such an occasion runs
a great hazard of faring indifferently. As it was, I had rather
a scanty supper; for perceiving it was _bon ton_ to eat of every
dish, and not knowing how many might follow, I did not duly profit
by the precious moments. Old Nazr ed Deen, who, as I have stated,
is reported to breakfast with such a voracious appetite, seemed by
no means satisfied, although I observed that he made the best use
of his time. The whole affair was finished in twenty minutes. Some
of the dishes were not one minute on the table. The Bey, with his
fugacious nod, reminded me of the physician at the island, who was
so considerate for Sancho Panza’s digestive powers. I ought not
to omit mentioning, that the Bey, as a special act of politeness to
myself, selected often the most delicate morsels from the best dishes,
with his own besmeared fingers, and placed them before me. I did not
quite relish such a greasy gratification, but was obliged to swallow
the compliment. Several slaves stood around the table with gullahs
of cool water,—the only beverage permitted; others had large fans
to keep away the flies. After we had performed our very necessary
ablutions, smoked a pipe, and taken coffee, the Bey dismissed his
court and attendants, and we had a long _tête-à-tête_ upon various
subjects. Although evidently a brave man, he finds the difficulties
of his situation trying and embarrassing. Having no trusty friend or
confidant near him, he seemed glad of an opportunity of disburdening
his grievances before a stranger, to whom there would be no disgrace
or humiliation in expressing his fears and difficulties. “I have few
or no friends here,” said he, “and many enemies. It is difficult
to satisfy the demands of the Pasha, and not oppress the people. The
Government at Alexandria are never content with the amount of the
revenue; and yet are enraged if any complaints reach them, although
they are the consequence of their own exorbitant demands; _but_
I hope God will give me _good luck_, and enable me to keep my place
to the satisfaction of my master.” We conversed about the province;
his manner of managing the Arabs, with the statistics of the country;
the affairs of the Pasha (to whom he seems very much attached, and
hopes to see him master of St. Petersburgh, or at all events, of the
recent acquisitions of that power from the Ottoman empire); the war
with the Sultan; the conquest of these provinces; his own military
exploits and valour; and the antiquities which are the object of my
journey. Understanding that my artist was an Italian, he displayed
his knowledge of that language, which extended only to two words,
_buono e morte_, by taking hold repeatedly of Mr. B.’s arm, and
at the same time that he repeated these words, he accompanied them
with such a powerful grasp, as almost made poor Signor B. scream
for pain.—“Anima del’ caina (del cane),” he said to me, in
the Neapolitan dialect, “_buono o cattivo_ mi pare che mi vuol
la _morte_.” Afterwards, the conversation turning upon animals,
he showed me the skin of a pet lion, that he had killed because it
had destroyed a sheep. I happened to appear pleased with it, when
he instantly made me accept it. He then sent for a beautiful little
monkey, of the grey capuchin kind, with which he also presented me. I
took it into my special protection, and christened it with the name
uppermost in my thoughts, namely, Meroe; and many a weary mile,
till my return to Thebes, did it beguile me with its mischievous
gambols on my camel. When I rose to take leave, the Bey said he
would accompany me to my tent, and then offered me a fine large
panther’s skin, on which he had been sitting. He did not give me
these, as the Turks in general make presents, with the expectation
of receiving others more valuable; for I told him, on receiving the
first, that I had not contemplated making this journey when I left
Europe, and had therefore nothing with me to offer him. He replied,
“All Turks are not the same; there are good and bad of every
nation: these are trifles; tell me how I can be of real service to
you; and the only return I wish is, that you think well of me when
you go to your own country.” He privately inquired of my dragoman
if we were in want of candles, sugar, coffee, of another tent, or
any thing else. Although we wanted nothing, we duly appreciated his
kind intention. The style in which he came to my tent, and went to
and from his harem every day, will give some idea of the state kept
up in these provincial governments. He was preceded by his guards,
armed with guns; then by four cowhasses, beating their massive
silver-headed sticks on the ground,—a substitute for music: the
Bey himself then followed, on foot or on his charger, having behind
him six other guards, with guns, and a crowd of perhaps twenty
servants. I was at a loss what return to make for his liberality:
he had really shown himself such a fine fellow, that it was painful
to be behind him in generosity. Having no suitable articles to spare,
such as a gun, pistols, or a watch, the most proper gifts to a Turk of
his rank, I could only beg his acceptance of a few trifles,—a new
patent powder-flask and belt, a bag of English shot, a good English
penknife, and a silver watch-guard. I gave him, also, a little stock
of medicines, with directions how to use them; these he valued very
highly, being aware on how slender a thread his life hangs in such
a baneful climate as this.

SHEAKH BESHER. The present Melek of Shendy.

SON OF A BISHAREEN SHEAKH.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

_March_ 1. This morning the Bey sent us a couple of fine sheep,
and, before we were dressed, a cowhass called to summon me to his
divan. He showed us his stables, in which were six horses, of the
true Dongolah breed, black and brown, of whom the black were the
finest, but all of them had rather upright pasterns, and four white
legs: sometimes the white extends over the thighs, and occasionally
over the belly. They are not light, slender horses like some of
the best race of Arabs, being more remarkable for their strength:
their appearance reminded me very much of the Egyptian horses,
as represented on the walls of Thebes. They would make magnificent
cavalry horses; but if they were brought on a race course, I think
their appearance would induce few to back them, except, perhaps,
for a _three-mile_ heat; certainly not for the St. Leger. The breed
is rare now, and valuable. Even here a good Dongolah horse fetches
from 50_l._ to 150_l._ After dinner he went to his harem to sleep,
and then returned to the government-house. He then sent for me again,
and kept me with him until ten at night. Dinner and supper were
served in the same style as on the preceding day.

_March_ 2. This morning the Bey sent for me as before, and kept me
till after dinner, when I started for Shendy in his own boat, which
he had the goodness to lend me. He invited me to make a longer stay,
but I had no time to lose. These three days, however, have not been
altogether mis-spent, as I have obtained some important information. I
complained to the Bey yesterday, that, on account of the prejudices
of the people, we were unable to draw any of the costumes of the
country. The Bey very coolly declared, that whoever dared to refuse,
he would cut off his head! Though this summary order was coolly
received in the divan, we did not hesitate to avail ourselves of
it, and immediately set to work, and drew the portraits of all the
dignitaries of consequence at his court. I have already referred
the reader to the portraits of Melek Nazr ed Deen, Sheakh Beshir,
and Sheakh Seyd. Some of them were very reluctant, in spite of all
our persuasion, particularly one native prince called Mousa. (See
coloured plate, XVI.) His likeness, taken by Signor B., is admirable,
the colour correct, and his figure is the finest specimen of manly
beauty I have seen in this country. His breast, as will be observed
in the plate, has somewhat of a projection, a peculiarity I have
often observed in Upper Nubia. It is considered a great deformity,
and those who have it often submit to a most painful operation for
its removal. Mousa, when my artist had finished his portrait, begged
the Bey to treat him as a man, and not show him like a beast. He
is the son of a melek, but now serves as a groom. He is famous for
his courage and dexterity in the use of the sabre. To use their own
exaggerated Oriental language, he is capable of killing 100 men in
battle. In our tent, yesterday, we took the figure and costume of a
Bishareen boy, about eighteen, whose father, a powerful sheakh, had
attempted to excite a revolt against the Pasha. Not being successful,
he fled, and his son was detained in prison until the father paid
a fine of 250 camels. By way of a jest, though a barbarous one,
which I should not have allowed had I known of it, the Bey and his
officers told the poor boy that we were to cut off his head, being
Turks deputed from Cairo for that special purpose. He sat down on
the ground in the attitude represented, with his head turned on one
side, and remained motionless, in the same position, nearly three
quarters of an hour. We remarked that we had never had a subject who
sat so patiently. When we had finished, we told him he might get up,
making him, at the same time, a small present; when, with a look of
bewildered delight, he told us how differently he expected to have
been treated, and that he had been awaiting every moment the stroke
of the sabre.

In the evening, when we were with the Bey, he sent for the poor
youth, and frightened him again by telling him that, by virtue
of the drawing we had made, we had a magical power over him,
and should transport him with us into our own country. He opened
his mouth aghast, asked every body if it were true, and seemed
struck with horror at the idea of never again seeing his native
deserts. He addressed his inquiries particularly to Sheakh Seyd,
who, as chief of the Ababdes, he did not think capable of deceiving
him; but I verily believe many of the meleks and chiefs present,
who affected to join in the laugh, really had doubts and misgivings
that such, in truth, was the necromantic power of our pencils, and
particularly of the camera lucida, with which I drew several of
them. My artist took the Bey’s likeness, at his own particular
desire; I conceive, for one of his favourites. He was very well
satisfied with the representation of his figure, rich costume, his
sword and accoutrements, and of the fierceness of his mustachios;
but he did not understand the shading, and begged my artist “to
take away those black things.” Before leaving Makkarif, the Bey
showed me round the indigo and hide manufactories belonging to the
government. I parted from him with some regret, for he is decidedly
the best Turk I have ever known; and it was a great pleasure for a
few days to meet with such courtesy in these wild regions of interior
Africa. Makkarif has little appearance of a capital. The bazaar should
scarcely be dignified with such a title, as it only consists of six or
seven miserable shops. The town is divided into seven divisions. The
population may, perhaps, amount to 3500, though it is difficult to
obtain exact information as to numbers. The houses are quadrangular
huts of one story, like those in Lower Egypt—not however crowded
together as those, but usually standing detached. Some of them are
circular, and have thatched conical roofs—a description of cottage
very general to the south of Berber. The residence of the governor,
and of some of the sheakhs, resembled the fortified house surrounded
by large courts, described at Abou-Hammed. There is here a large
manufactory of indigo, a valuable branch of culture, which was
introduced by the Pasha into this province five years ago. They
cut it three times during the season, at intervals of about two
months. To extract the dye, they place the stalks and leaves for
eighteen hours in a cemented mud basin or cistern of water, which
is then drawn off into another vessel: in this last they leave
it only a few hours, stirring it well with sticks, and afterwards
let it off into a caldron, in which the final process of boiling
takes place, and indigo is produced of very good quality. The Pasha
receives from this manufactory nearly 14,000 okres (weight), which
is sent to Cairo, and sold there for fifteen dollars per okre. The
government has greatly extended the cultivation of the cotton plant
in this province. Considerable quantities of wheat and oats are also
grown in it; but barley and dourah, particularly the latter, are
the chief produce. In the Turkish province of Berber, which extends
from Abou-Hammed to two days journey beyond Shendy, there are 6000
feddans (measure) of cultivated land, and 500 sakkeas. There were 800
of the latter, when first the Pasha took possession of the country,
but misrule, or, perhaps, the system inevitably adopted in order to
subdue entirely the country, has impoverished as well as depopulated
it. The number of peasants, merchants, Arabs, and other residents,
so far as I have been able to learn, may be estimated (including
their families) at 30,000: this is independent of the Bishareen and
other desert tribes who pay their tribute here. The number of sakkeas
may appear small in comparison to the extent of the cultivation and
the number of the inhabitants; but it may be remarked, that a great
proportion of the arable land in this province is irrigated by the
inundation of the Nile and by manual labour. Besides, the peasants,
as well as the wandering tribes, subsist in a great measure by their
flocks and by their camels, which are bred in great numbers, and of
the finest quality, and sent to Cairo. Many also are sold here to
the merchants and carriers of this place; also to those of Shendy and
Sennaar. The price of a strong, ordinary camel is about ten or twelve
dollars; of a dromedary, ten to thirty dollars. For several years
the government have sent to Cairo from 1500 to 2000 hides. This year
the Pasha has required 20,000. These hides are prepared with lime,
salt, and the pod of the mimosa. The Pasha has also tried the sugar
cane, which flourishes luxuriantly in the islands, though the people
have not yet acquired any skill in the manufacture of it. There is
a small sugar-house, but of the rudest construction. The canes are
placed between two rollers, turned by oxen, which squeeze out the
juice. The peasants themselves make a coarse kind of linen cloth,
which may be called fine canvass, but seldom deserves a better name.

Pliny says, that Ethiopia, as well as Egypt, was by the Greeks
called _Etheria_, “without wool;” which may have been owing
to the circumstance, that the Ethiopians, like the Egyptians,
wore only linen; but perhaps it may rather allude to the extremely
bad quality of the Ethiopian wool. The Bishareen pay their tribute
to this government. They occupy the territory, and are generally
supposed to be descendants, of the ancient Troglodites; but there
is a name sculptured on the walls of Thebes, of a captured people,
called Sharim, which, with the Coptic article Pi, makes Pisharim
or Bisharim. Souakim, the capital, is fifteen days’ journey from
this place, on which road water is found every day and a half:
its inhabitants are called Edherbi and Hadendoah. Besides these,
the Bishareen have other subordinate divisions, as the Amarrah
and the Benishamah. As I have before stated, they are the most
uncivilised of the Arab tribes, if they can be called Arabs, when
they speak a language without any Arabic words, and lay no claim
to Arabian descent. Their features are often striking, but their
manner of dressing their hair, making it bushy and prominent both in
front and behind, and often shaving it a little, gives them a savage
appearance. Their dress generally consists of folds of linen of the
country, often ragged and dirty, but always put on in a graceful
manner, not unlike the ancient Greek drapery. War and plunder seem
to be their element, and they are accused of being treacherous and
deceitful: they are addicted also to petty theft. Many are poor
in the extreme; some few rich and powerful, living luxuriously,
as they deem it, on camels’ flesh and milk. The principal persons
at Makkarif tell me that they count 200,000 houses or tents; but,
notwithstanding the vast extent of their territory, this must be
an exaggeration. The government finds always great difficulty in
collecting their tribute. “We generally send,” said the Bey,
“two soldiers at a time. If they are murdered, it is of no great
consequence! for two men it would be absurd to lay waste a whole
province; but if we sent twenty or thirty, and they were destroyed,
it would create great alarm, and be a serious loss out of my small
force of 400 cavalry. Once,” said he, with an air of triumph,
“I was there with a large retinue, when a greatly superior number
of Bishareen attacked us, during the night, as is always their
custom. Nine of my men fled at the first onset, and falling into
the hands of the enemy were immediately massacred. We resisted and
escaped, but it caused great terror among my troops. Soon after we
avenged the death of my nine brave fellows in our usual manner. We
enticed to this place many of the Bishareen engaged in this affair by
a promise of pardon: then we enclosed them in one of our fortified
houses, and put them to death.” Some divisions of this tribe,
who are almost quite independent, often plunder the caravans and
small villages, and carry off cattle and other property; and they
sometimes extend their predatory incursions as far as Dongolah.

The Ababdes are divided principally into two tribes, the Maleykab,
from Esneh to Assuan; and the Hashibani, from Assuan to Kash
Kosseer. They are a fine race of men, and wear their hair in
ringlets hanging behind their heads, and at the sides, nearly to
their shoulders. Sometimes, but very rarely, their hair is bushy
in front like the Bishareen. Their dress of coarse linen is always
folded around them with the same graceful elegance. This tribe is
much less numerous than the Bishareen, but they have the character
of being braver. The number of their houses and tents was stated
to me by their chief, Sheakh Sayd, at 50,000. During the conquest
of this country, and on other occasions, they have been of great
service to the Pasha, who therefore levies no direct tribute except
from such as have allotments of land, and sakkeas, who pay for them
like the peasants of the Nile. Burckhardt speaks of the treachery of
the Ababdes. I have been with them for months in the Oasis Magna and
other places, and cannot say I have experienced it. On the contrary,
I have observed them more grateful for kindness, more attached,
more proud of their liberty, and tenacious of their character, and
more disinterested, than any other of the Arab tribes. The number
domiciled in this province is very considerable. Besides these,
I saw individuals of several other Arab tribes who frequent Berber,
while others I only heard of. Among these are the Hassanyeh, who range
from Berber to Kordofan, principally near Dongolah,—the Kababysh,
to the south-west of the latter, extending to the White River,—the
Benegerar, from Dongolah to Kordofan, in the Desert,—the Erfara,
near Sennaar,—a large and powerful tribe called Rafarah, numbered
with the Erfara,—the Shukriah, settled principally near Shendy,
but also between Berber and Sennaar, and the Atbara and the Bahr
el Azruk. The Eddibina, also, near Shendy,—the Djamelyeh, on
the Bahr el Abiad,—the El Amran, to the east of the Mugrum, or
Astoboras,—the Shelouks, ten days up the White River, or Bahr al
Abiad. They are said to be tall, powerful men, always quite naked,
and armed with bows and arrows, spears and shields; and I am told
that they worship the sun. Their territory extends for a considerable
distance on both sides of the river, but the division on the east
side is called Denha. The Shelouks inhabit also numerous islands,
communicating with each other by means of canoes, some of which are
very large. The Bahr el Abiad was represented to me as being, in that
part, ten times wider than the Bahr el Azruk:—the Numrum, also,
a negro race of naked Pagans, twenty days’ journey from Sennaar,
upon the White River. All these tribes, except the two last, are
wholly or partly tributary to the Pasha. When we consider the slight
comparative force with which his governments are generally supplied,
we must confess his officers know how to manage their affairs,
although the means they adopt are not always the most honourable. The
government of Berber has only 400 cavalry to keep in subjection
a population of 30,000, besides the many powerful tribes of the
neighbouring deserts. The ancient chiefs of the country are almost
all alive and at large. Each native is armed, and acquainted with the
use of the sabre and lance, and some few have matchlocks. They see
the prosperity of the country gradually decaying, and the population
daily diminishing; yet such is their terror of the Pasha’s power,
that, notwithstanding the small number of his troops, and the length
of time it would require to bring forward reinforcements, no monarch
in Europe has such absolute power, or sleeps more safe from bodily
fear than the Governor of Berber. The relentless system, which has
completely succeeded in Lower Egypt, of impoverishing the peasants,
and reducing them by distress to complete vassalage, is gradually
but successfully carried on by the Pasha in this country. The
descendants, perhaps, of those tribes who defied the power of
the Greeks and Romans, have been taught by Mohammed Ali to crouch
beneath his yoke. He has done so, in despite of all the obstacles man
and nature opposed to his ambition;—a brave resistance, cataracts
amongst which many of his barks were lost, the horrors of the desert,
burning climate, malaria, and fever, which at first nearly annihilated
his army at “one fell swoop.” The statement of Cailliaud, that
at Sennaar, the Pasha saw one third of his forces fall a prey to
malignant and intermittent fevers, dysentery, and bilious attacks,
shows at how dear a price these conquests were purchased. But
the Pasha’s power in this country rests now on a basis which it
would be difficult to shake,—a combination of vigorous policy in
council, with superiority of arms and discipline in the field. The
tribes now know from experience the weakness of their half fighting,
half dancing hosts, with their lances, swords, and large unwieldy
shields,—against the regular fire of disciplined troops. The very
report of a cannon is irresistible to beings who have the utmost
dread of a musket; and they can now contrast the effects of artillery
with those of the comparatively harmless implements of their own
warfare, which seldom inflict more than flesh wounds. Their former
chiefs and meleks are now sinking fast to the wretched level of the
peasants. Stripped of their patrimonial wealth and estates, and shut
out from their other sources of gain—commerce and exactions—they
are now obliged to pay court to the Turkish governors, to obtain
or preserve a scanty pension, which is almost their only means of
subsistence. The chiefs have suffered more than the peasants from
the domination of the Pasha, who has followed the usual policy of
all conquerors, by systematically aiming “to cut off the highest
of the poppy heads.” The great mass of the people of every nation
are generally indifferent to the misfortunes of the aristocracy,
and are rarely animated, by individual attachment, or more enlarged
views of national independence, to rise and deliver from oppression
those who, perhaps, were once their own oppressors. Possibly, they
may even feel a selfish exultation in seeing them reduced to their
own level; forgetting that, while their ancient chiefs sink thus
into poverty and obscurity, every hope of restoring the liberty of
their country vanishes.

I have not spent sufficient time in this province to judge accurately
of the character of the people, and I dare scarcely attempt to
delineate what the masterly hand of Burckhardt has so admirably
accomplished. I have not his work with me, and do not remember
minutely his account of the natives of this district. I must,
therefore, make a short record of my own observations, though,
probably, they will add but little to the information which he has
communicated. I am sorry to confirm his statement, that the most
extreme profligacy of manners prevails among the Berbers. They are
entirely devoted to women; unfortunately, not only to their own wives,
but, with lawless passion, to the wives of their neighbours. Adultery
is far more common here than in any other part of the valley of the
Nile; and there exists, also, in this and the adjoining provinces,
a system which is a disgrace to human nature. The sheakhs, meleks,
and chief men hire out their female slaves, or, rather, oblige them
to carry on an infamous traffic here and in the different villages,
and to pay to their master a monthly tribute out of the fruits. This
is the climax of profligacy. A correct idea of the immoral state
of the country may be formed, when those who, from their station,
ought to endeavour to repress vice, are, by this system, its chief
promoters. Slavery is horrible under any guise; but when the task
of the unfortunate victim is to sacrifice every principle of honour,
virtue, and decency, in order to satiate the avarice of a remorseless
master, a more distressing picture of human wretchedness cannot be
imagined. Besides the monthly tribute, they are dependent also for
their own subsistence upon the passing caravans.

The superstition of the Berbers keeps pace with their gross
ignorance. I have already stated that, notwithstanding many attempts,
I was never able, unless in the Bey’s presence, and through his
despotic mandate, to overcome the apprehension and scruples of the
Berbers, of both sexes, to allow their portraits to be drawn. Among
those, too, who knew I was a Christian, I could often distinguish
an ill-disguised contempt when I deviated in any respect from the
Mahometan customs.

Intoxication is another vice to which the Berbers are generally
addicted, but seldom to any very gross excess. Their beverage
is the bouza, a species of beer made of dourah, boiled in a jar,
and drunk after a day or two, when it ferments. It is not of a very
intoxicating quality, but they drink gallons of it at a sitting. One
of the peasants intimated to me his regret that the Prophet had only
promised them rivers of milk in his paradise, instead of bouza. They
have also the meresi and bulbul, more delicate descriptions of the
same beverage; and a strong but tasteless spirit (arrake), with a
very wretched liquor which they call wine; both these last being
extracted from the date. They are civil and attentive to strangers,
but there is something overstrained in their obsequiousness. They
have the reputation of being great thieves. Several old Egyptian
merchants, and also my camel-drivers, advised me to take care of
my baggage during the night, when I passed through Berber; always
recommending me, for that reason, to encamp near the house of the
sheakh. The women go about with their faces uncovered,—a privilege
which, in Egypt, only the wives of the Arabs of the Desert enjoy. They
have, generally, good figures, and a rather pleasing expression of
countenance. The men are stout, but their features are seldom very
prepossessing, or at all noble; and they are deficient in that open
and dignified manner and deportment which distinguish the generality
of the Arab tribes. The Arabs in general, but especially the Berbers,
are averse to active exertion. I have often seen several of them
sitting together for many hours in the shade, with their eyes half
closed, in a listless and supine state, neither talking, nor engaged
in any occupation. Sometimes they were smoking, yet at the same time
apparently unconscious that pipes were in their mouths. Perfect
repose of body and mind, the _dolce far niente_ of the Italians,
is the highest felicity they are able to conceive. Endowed with
an imperturbable stock of apathy,—more comfortable, perhaps,
although not so intellectual, as European philosophy,—they submit
to a distressing accident, which would throw one of our countrymen
almost into a fever, without allowing their equanimity to be in the
least disturbed. “_Mactub min Allah!_” it is written, It is the
will of God! they exclaim, with placid resignation; and, instead of
brooding over their misfortune, become immediately reconciled to it,
and, with amazing facility, banish it from their thoughts.

The Sennaar and Shendy merchants, chiefly Arabs, pass sometimes by
this route; others go to Dongolah, across the Bahiouda desert. This
is, however, a much shorter route, and for that reason often
preferred. They furnish the bazaar of Makkarif with soap, spices
with which they make an ointment to keep their skin soft, rice,
Mocha coffee, mirrors, glass beads, and shells; and articles in
cotton, such as handkerchiefs, shawls, and other dresses: they
also bring tobacco and pipes, crockery, cooking dishes, &c. A great
many camels are employed on this route, in conveying the officers,
soldiers, and provisions from Assuan to Berber, Shendy, Khartoun,
and Sennaar. When no other article is ready, the camels are laden,
in return, with charcoal made of the osshi plant, which is excellent
for gunpowder; but even for culinary use, the difference between
its price at Berber and at Assuan, in consequence of its scarcity at
the latter place, fully remunerates them for the carriage. A great
number of camels are, at certain seasons, employed by the government
in conveying down to Assuan the indigo, grain, hides, &c. levied as
taxes in kind. This gives employment to the Arabs of the desert, and
attaches these roving tribes, by the strongest chains of interest,
to a more regular and less barbarous government than they have ever
been accustomed to, and thus reconciles them to the relinquishment
of their independence. When we consider the predatory and lawless
habits they gloried in for ages previous to the Pasha’s conquest;
the anarchy and confusion which afforded them such facilities for
rapine, and in which their bold unruly spirits delighted, as the
short though dangerous path to distinction and wealth,—it is
surprising to see them thus quietly occupied in the vocations of
peace, and earning their livelihood by honest industry. A tribute of
applause is certainly due to Mohammed Ali, for effecting this great
improvement in the habits and pursuits of the uncivilised hordes
who occupy so considerable a portion of the continent of Africa.

_March_ 8. We set sail, with a favourable breeze, from Makkarif,
at one; and at half past one we passed the village of El Releh;
and at two, Sowektab el Ekaba, on the western bank of the river;
opposite to which, on the east bank, is a small village called
Howed. At four we passed Wady Rowel, on the eastern side; at five,
the small village of Sidin on the same side; at six, a large village
called Karmim; at three quarters past six we passed Sayal, a small
village on the east bank; at a quarter past seven, Dakkel, on the
same side; at twenty minutes past seven, El Fodlet; and at half
past seven we moored for the night at the village of Unmatur, on the
western side. We have had a good wind, and certainly cannot have made
less than three miles an hour. Opposite to Unmatur is the junction of
the Mugrum, the ancient Astaboras, with the Nile, isolating from the
Nubian and Libyan desert this part of Meroe. For some distance before
reaching it, I observed that the colour of the water was very green,
and had not the usual appearance of the Nile, which is comparatively
clear at this season. I perceived also that the taste was different,
and that it had a strong disagreeable smell. I regret that it is now
dusk, so that I cannot observe more accurately the distinction of
the waters of the two rivers; but I am informed, that for some space
after the confluence, they remain unmixed. The width of the Mugrum,
as the Astaboras is now called, from what I could learn, is, at the
time of the rise, about 1000 feet. At this season, they tell me,
it is almost stagnant. It swells many days earlier than the Bahr
el Abiad or the Azruk; and I think the green colour that tinges
the whole Nile for the first thirty or forty days after its rise,
may be attributed to the influx of the waters of this river. The
chief province or district on its banks is called Atbara, evidently
a corruption from the ancient name of the river, which is curious,
as any analogy is rarely to be found between the modern and ancient
names in this country. Two hours before arriving at the junction, we
passed a small shellal (cataract). The current was strong; a number
of small rocks impeding the stream for about half way across. The
banks are covered with beautiful groves of acacias, doums, and palm
trees, and had generally a much more verdant appearance than we had
before remarked; reminding me most forcibly of the observation of
the pretorians sent by Nero:


  Herbas circa Meroen demum viridiores, silvarumque aliquid
  apparuisse.[12]


From the best information I have been able to obtain, there are seven
days’ journey from the mouth of the Mugrum to Goss Radjeb, the
principal village on its banks: for the two first days, the direction
of this river is nearly east. There are on this route few villages;
the habitations chiefly consisting of encampments of migratory Arabs,
who change their stations as often as they need fresh pasture for
their camels and flocks. The chief tribe frequenting the banks of the
Astaboras is that of the Bishareen; but its branches were described to
me as distinguished by the following distinct names: The first day’s
journey east, is called the district of the Atbara; the second,
that of the Eddandoweh; the third day, towards the south, Attaka;
the fourth, Giberta; the fifth, Medkirab; after which the district of
Makkadi extends several days beyond Goss Radjeb. A merchant informed
me, that, at this latter place, there are the remains of a temple,
but without any sculpture, columns, or hieroglyphics. According to
the accounts given to me by the most intelligent Arabs, this river
abounds much more than the Nile in hippopotami and crocodiles,
and the western bank is infested with lions.

_March_ 3. Leaving Unmatur at seven, with a good wind, we began our
voyage on what Strabo calls the river Astapus, but which the natives
still call the Nile: passed, at a quarter past seven, the village of
Hassal, west side, and El Dahmur east, at nine, Abouselam west, and
Ambori east; at half past nine, Hossya east, Maholrab west; at half
past ten, the island of Essaydrab; at twelve, the island of Gunnabra
and the village of El Roweh west; at half past one, El Howyeh east,
El Ferakah west; at three, the island of Tumfar, and the village
of Alioh, to the east; at half past three, the island of Egaydag,
and village of the same name, on the western bank; at half past four,
the island of Nama; at three quarters past five, Gebata to the east,
and Keytayab to the west. This day I have observed that some of the
villages consist of circular huts with thatched conical roofs. The
water has not the same colour nor the same disagreeable smell as
that near the mouth of the Astaboras. We have seen many crocodiles
and several hippopotami: upon our approach they disappeared under
the water; but occasionally raised their enormous heads, which,
at the distance we were then, appeared like those of buffaloes. We
fired at them, but without any effect. The Arabs state that their
only vulnerable part is their forehead. What Hasselquist says of
the manner of destroying them, by placing salt peas on the bank,
the eating of which may excite them to drink until they die,
amused the Arabs vastly. Their only way of killing these animals,
is by concealing themselves in the long grass or corn fields on the
bank, near one of their tracks. When the hippopotamus approaches,
they attack and pierce him with a barbed lance, to which a strong
cord is attached. The animal rushes to the river, and they follow
him warily on the banks, or in a boat, until his strength is quite
exhausted, and he is almost dead. His usual expiring effort is to
make for the shore, or his pursuers drag him thither as an angler
does a fish. The peasants sometimes keep up fires during the night,
to preserve their crops from his ravages. I observed to-day several
beautiful woods on the islands; and, for the first time, monkeys—the
small Grey Capuchin species.

_Bagromeh Meroe.—March_ 4. During the last night we have passed
the following villages:—

  On the west bank.          Islands.              East bank.

Agatharchides says the Astaboras unites its stream with the Nile,
and forms the Island of Meroe; and Strabo (lib. 17.) says Meroe is
formed by the conflux of the Astapus and Astaboras. Diodorus states
the island to be 375 miles long, and 125 wide. The exact distance
from Syene to Meroe is stated by Pliny to have been a subject of
great dispute even in his time; which is the more extraordinary,
when we consider the number of travellers who had then visited
and even penetrated beyond the capital of Ethiopia. Pliny first
mentions Delion as having travelled far beyond Meroe; afterwards
Aristocreon, Bion, Basilis, and Simonides the younger, who wrote
an account of that city. Timosthenes was sixty days in making the
voyage by water. Eratosthenes reckoned the distance 625,000 paces, and
Artemidorus 600,000. Bion gives us a list of towns, but no distances:
the sixty days of Timosthenes, by water, is too indefinite a date to
be of any use, although it agrees tolerably well with the account of
Herodotus.[13] The 625,000 paces of Eratosthenes, equal to 590 miles,
is about the length of the direct caravan road, which I find to be 560
miles to the town. Artemidorus’s distance of 600,000 paces, equal
to 568 miles, agrees more closely with my ascertained distance of that
route, that is, across the Great Desert, by Korosko and Abou-Hammed.

GENERAL PLAN OF THE PYRAMIDS OF MEROE.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

Pliny says that this dispute concerning the distance to Meroe was
finally settled by the prætorians and tribune sent by Nero for the
purpose of exploring the country, which he had some intention to
make a conquest of. There is little doubt, I conceive, that these
men would follow the Nile, in order to observe all the towns, and
report what resources there would be for an army. This will account
for their calculating the distance to the island at 874,000 paces
(817 English miles). Following most of the sinuosities of the Nile,
I find it about forty miles more; but, as it cannot be supposed
that they did not occasionally avail themselves of some of the many
shorter routes now followed by the caravans, this may be considered
to correspond with sufficient exactness.

Pliny computes from Napata to the Island of Meroe, 360,000 paces (340
English miles). If Gibel el Birkel be the site of ancient Napata,
the distance by the longest road is only 240, a difference of 100
miles; I therefore conceive that Gibel el Birkel cannot be the site
of the ancient city of Napata, which, I think, we must look for 100
miles lower down the river, perhaps at Old Dongolah. Ptolemy places
it much more to the north. Pliny says, that from the commencement of
the island to the town is 70,000 paces (66 English miles). I found
the distance to be nearly 60 miles; a difference only of 6 miles:
but these discrepancies are not surprising when we consider the vague
information and dubious authorities from which he acknowledges that
he compiled his account. I suggested, in crossing the Great Desert,
the probability of its having formerly contained establishments
and wells, at different stations, for the convenience of a more
civilised population, and of this route having been anciently much
more frequented by travellers. There is every reason then to suppose
that Eratosthenes and Artemidorus took this route; which will make
their calculations, as well as those of the prætorians by the Nile,
accord very satisfactorily with the position of these ruins. Without
bringing forward other proofs, the authority of Ptolemy is sufficient
to dispel any doubt that might possibly remain upon the subject. That
geographer places the capital of Ethiopia in latitude 16° 26′;
a difference only of 30′ from the observation of Cailliaud. It
is impossible to conceive the observation of that geographer to be
exactly correct (which, indeed, is rarely the case); for, besides
the absence of other ruins, we cannot imagine that there could have
been another town so near the capital with such splendid cemeteries
as these.

Never were my feelings more ardently excited than in approaching,
after so tedious a journey, to this magnificent Necropolis. The
appearance of the Pyramids, in the distance, announced their
importance; but I was gratified beyond my most sanguine expectations,
when I found myself in the midst of them. The pyramids of Geezah
are magnificent, wonderful from their stupendous magnitude; but for
picturesque effect and elegance of architectural design, I infinitely
prefer these of Meroe. I expected to find few such remains here, and
certainly nothing so imposing, so interesting, as these sepulchres,
doubtless of the kings and queens of Ethiopia. I stood for some time
lost in admiration. From every point of view I saw magnificent groups,
pyramid rising behind pyramid, while the dilapidated state of many
did not render them less interesting, though less beautiful as works
of art. I easily restored them in my imagination; and these effects
of the ravages of time carried back my thoughts to more distant ages.

Plate VIII. faithfully represents the principal group of the
pyramids, and their present state of preservation, and the annexed
view exhibits the most interesting of that group in detail. As every
stone in these plates is drawn with the camera lucida, the reader
will have the opportunity of studying their construction, and I may
also add (particularly in the case of Plate IX.), of appreciating
their picturesque appearance.

PRINCIPAL GROUP OF THE PYRAMIDS OF MEROE.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The porticoes on the east side of each pyramid soon attracted my
attention, and I passed eagerly from one to the other, delighted
to find in several of them tablets of sculpture and hieroglyphics,
which, few as they are, have, I trust, given us the assurance of
the locality, and will, I hope, throw some light upon the mythology
and arts of the Ethiopians. There are the remains and traces of
eighty of these pyramids (see Plate V.): they consist chiefly in
three groups. The principal and most imposing, at which I arrived
first, is situated on a hill, two miles and a half from the river,
commanding an extensive view of the plain. This group is arranged (see
Plate VI.) nearly in the form of a bow, the string of which from A to
W is 1050 feet, and following the curved _alignement_ of the pyramids
from A to D, 625; D to W, 850, making in total extent 1425 feet.

[Illustration: PYRAMIDS OF MEROE.]

The plan will show that no regularity has been maintained in
their position. Thus, the façade of portico A (see Plan) faces
about north-east, while the generality of the other porticoes vary
from east to south-east. The circumstance of the porticoes fronting
generally towards the east, and not one to the north and south-west,
proves a religious observance; but that there was no astronomical
object in view, in their porticoes facing the rising sun, is certain
from the variation in the directions, and from there being no attempt
at mathematical precision. Although we cannot attribute to them the
scientific object conceived by some to have been contemplated in the
location of the pyramids of Memphis, still a happier combination of
position could not be imagined for producing upon the mind those
impressive feelings which the royal cemeteries of kings of an age
so distant, and of a nation once so great and powerful, naturally
inspire.[14]

The following account of the different measurements of the pyramids
will show the dissimilarity of their size. A (see Plate VI.) is 32
feet square; B, 42 feet square; C, 52 feet square; D, 31 feet from
east to west, and 27 feet 6 inches from north to south; F, 60 feet
square; G, joined to the latter, of the same size; H, 63 feet square;
I, 42 feet 6 inches by 40 feet; K, 42 feet square; L, 26 feet 6 inches
by 23 feet 6 inches; M, 26 feet 6 inches by 21 feet; N, 29 feet
square; O, 63 (this is without a portico); P, only 17 feet square,
without a portico; R, 61 feet square; S, 30 feet square; T, 50 feet
square; U, 29 feet square, V, 37 feet north to south, 39 feet east to
west; W, 20 feet square; X, 20 feet square. Seven marked Y consist of
pyramids in such a ruined condition that the exact plan cannot now
be ascertained; but some of them, from the size of the porticoes,
which can still be traced, have evidently been of importance.

PYRAMIDS OF MEROE.

_London. Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The pyramids (Plate No. VII.) restored architecturally, will give the
best idea of their original form and ornaments. The pyramid No. 3. is
60 feet in diameter at the base, and 60 feet high; and is constructed,
like most of the others, as shown in the plates, of stones, generally
one foot high and two feet and a half long. The rim at the angles
of No. III. is a great additional beauty; and many of them are thus
ornamented. Most of them can be ascended; but the surfaces of some
(as of Nos. 1. and 2.) are quite smooth. The appearance of a window in
No. 1., thirteen feet from the summit, is curious; but it is merely
an architectural ornament, and not for the purpose of admitting
light into any room of the interior. There are thirty-one pyramids
in the group, of which the plans of twenty-three may be traced;
while to the south-east is another group of thirteen, in some degree
of preservation, as will be seen by the above view. There are three
other groups, two consisting of two pyramids each, and the other of
six (see General Plan, Plate V.); and at 5600 feet to the west of
the chief group, may be traced the remains of twenty-five pyramids,
but almost buried.

[Illustration: SOUTH-EAST GROUP OF THE PYRAMIDS OF MEROE.]

The porticoes I have before mentioned, situated on the eastern side
of all the pyramids, consist generally of one room, which varies from
12 to 6 feet in length, and from 11 to 6 feet in width. The portico
of pyramid H consists of two rooms, the one leading out of the other:
the first 8 feet long and 12 feet broad; the second the same breadth,
but only 6 feet in length. Three steps, each 8 inches deep and 6
inches high, lead into the portico of No. 3. Plate VII. The doorway
is 3 feet 10 inches deep; the portico is 13 feet 8 inches long, and
7 feet 6 inches wide; the height of the façade is 18 feet 4 inches.

The façades of these porticoes are very elegant. In their forms
we can clearly trace the origin of the Egyptian propylons. That
of No. 3. Plate VII. consists of a doorway 3 feet wide, and the
doorposts 6 inches wide. Above the door is an architrave, over which
is a square beading, and over it, as in Egyptian edifices, rises a
cornice ornamented with the globe and wings. The door is 11 feet 6
inches high, and, including the architrave and cornice, 14 feet. The
buttresses, on each side of the door, have a slight inclination
inwards, but not so much as the Egyptian propylons. They measure at
their base 7 feet 6 inches, at their summit 7 feet; others, 5 feet by
4 feet 8 inches and 5 feet by 4 feet 10 inches. These measurements
include the square beading at the angles. In Egyptian architecture
this beading would be round. The square form here adopted, being
more simple, affords another reason for supposing that the first
idea of this great ornament to the Egyptian temples originated in
Ethiopia. The height of this portico is 11 feet 4 inches: that of
the pylons of all the porticoes nearly the same, whatever may be the
height of the pyramids; but the length and width of the porticoes
seem to vary in proportion to the size of the pyramids. At the
extremity of most of these porticoes, opposite the entrance, is the
representation of a monolithic temple, ornamented with sculpture,
all very much defaced.

PYRAMIDS OF MEROE.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

It is evident that, from motives of curiosity, or perhaps avarice,
attempts have been made to open many of the pyramids, but without
success. From the appearance of those which have been partially broken
into, I do not perceive the slightest probability that any of them
contain galleries. Probably they are constructed over wells in which
the bodies are deposited. That they are places of sepulture cannot be
doubted, from their position, number, and, most particularly, from
the subjects of the sculpture on the walls, which I will presently
describe. One of the porches or porticoes is most interestingly
curious, the roof being arched, in a regular masonic style, with what
may be called a keystone. (See Plate VII.) This arch consists of four
and five stones alternately; but, notwithstanding this irregularity,
the principle is the same, the stones being held together only by
lateral pressure. I trust to be able to establish, beyond dispute,
that the arch has its origin in Ethiopia. The style of the sculpture
in this portico, and the hieroglyphic names of kings on porticoes
ornamented in a similar style, being, as I hope to prove, much more
ancient than any in Egypt, where there is no specimen of a stone arch
constructed in so regular a manner, we may consider such proficiency
in architectural knowledge as a decided proof of the advanced state
of the arts, at a very remote period, in this country.[15]

A question which has long engaged the attention of literary men is,
whether the Ethiopians derived their knowledge of the arts from the
Egyptians, or the latter from the former. One of these hypotheses
must be admitted, as the similarity of the style evidently denotes
a common origin. These pyramids belong, without doubt, to the
remotest age. No edifice, perhaps, is better calculated to resist
the ravages of time, or the destructive efforts of man, than the
pyramid; particularly when constructed, as these are, without any
chambers in the interior. In a country where earthquakes are unknown,
little rain falls, and the wind is seldom violent, ages must elapse
before these vast masses of stone could be much dilapidated, unless
buried by the desert, or carried away by man as materials for other
buildings. The porticoes even of the pyramids that are standing,
although adapted to their proportions, are almost all injured, and
most of them destroyed. There are no symptoms of fanatical violence
having been exercised on what remains. Their ruined and defaced
condition must be entirely attributed to their great antiquity.[16]

The sculpture is in a very peculiar style, which can scarcely
be called good: the large figures, in particular, display a
certain rotundity of form which I never observed in any Egyptian
sculpture. The smaller figures have also this peculiarity; but,
from their dimensions, it is not quite so perceptible, at least
not so striking. The hieroglyphics are very much defaced; indeed,
those I have copied are almost all that remain. The Ethiopians did
not group their hieroglyphics so well as the Egyptians: their striking
deficiency, in this respect, proves either a great corruption from the
Egyptian style, or, most probably, a great improvement made by the
latter on the Ethiopian invention. This is the more extraordinary,
as Diodorus informs us that the knowledge of hieroglyphics was,
in Egypt, confined to the priests: but that, in Ethiopia, they were
understood by all.

To any one who, like me, has made a long study of Egyptian monuments,
the style of the sculpture, even in the absence of any known name,
is generally sufficient to determine its epoch. This fact, of which
those travellers who have spent any length of time in Egypt will
be fully aware, may give additional weight to my opinion of this
sculpture. It is all executed in basso relievo, with the exception
of the hieroglyphics, which are in intaglio. The style is certainly
by no means equal to the best at Thebes. It is unlike the style
of the age of Osirtesen, the Thothmes, Rameses II. (Augustan age),
Rameses III. (first decline), the florid style during the reign of
Psammitichus, or the clumsy inelegant productions of the Persian
(I refer to the sculpture in the temple of Darius in the Oasis
Magna), Ptolemaic, or Roman dynasties. There is no resemblance to
any of these styles, or appearance of its being a corruption from
them. The ornaments, on the fragments which still exist, are all
evidently peculiar to the country. Of the few that still remain,
many are not found in Egypt, and appear to represent the rites of
a religion much more simple and pure than the corrupted Egyptian
mythology. They bear the stamp of originality, and I should say,
therefore, that the Ethiopian style is antecedent to the others;
that it is the earliest, though not the best.

PYRAMIDS OF MEROE.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

“The Ethiopians,” says Diodorus, “describe the Egyptians as one
of their colonies led into Egypt by Osiris. They pretend, also, that
Egypt, at the commencement of the world, was nothing but a morass;
and that the inundations of the Nile, carrying down a great quantity
of the alluvial soil of Ethiopia, had at length filled it up, and
made it a part of the continent; and we see,” he says, “at the
mouth of the Nile, a particularity which seems to prove that the
formation of Egypt is the work of the river. After the inundation,
we remark that the sea has repelled on the shore large masses of
the alluvial soil, and that the land is increased.” Many writers
on Egypt have confirmed this statement of Diodorus. The gradual
increase of the depth of soil around different antiquities enabled
the French _savants_, unassisted by the science of hieroglyphics,
to decide, in many instances with tolerable accuracy, the date of
their construction. The depth of the alluvial soil has ever been,
and still continues, increasing; and as this progressive increase may,
in every instance, be ascertained, there must have been a period when
there was little or none; when Egypt was a mere morass, or rather a
desert. The great population, power, riches, and civilisation of the
Egyptians astonish us, particularly as we know that their prosperity
was almost entirely derived from agriculture, and that the fertility
of the land was produced altogether by the periodical overflowings
of the Nile. These spread abundance and happiness over the country,
created numberless beautiful islands, and changed into a smiling,
luxuriant valley what was originally a morass, or, more properly
speaking, an arid desert.


  “Et viridem Ægyptum nigrâ fœcundat arenâ.”[17]


The first cause, then, of all this fruitfulness was Ethiopia. No
one, I think, will conceive it probable that a country originally
possessing such advantages could have been long unselected by
the descendants of Noah. Herodotus also calls the Ethiopians
aboriginal. Considering, then, the rapidity with which man
multiplies in a hot climate where no Malthusian restraints operate,
and in the full enjoyment of the ease and abundance which so rich
a soil must have secured to them, I think it not unreasonable to
conclude that Ethiopia, even before Egypt emerged from the Nile,
was peopled by a numerous and powerful race. I cannot conceive that
a country possessing such agricultural and other advantages—and
probably, on that account, the resort of surrounding and less
favoured nations—could long remain poor. Riches would introduce
a taste for elegance, and afford encouragement to invention; hence
the arts would derive their origin. The population increasing,
while the land, owing to the spoliations of the river, diminished in
extent and richness, the necessity of emigration became obvious. At
the command of their oracle, as was their custom (see Herodotus,
ii. 139.), they quitted their homes and proceeded along the course
of the river; settling in the lower valley of the Nile: they would
plant there the religion, arts, and knowledge of their country. This
conclusion is confirmed by the following strong passage from Diodorus,
proving historically what is my own conviction from the examination of
their monumental remains. “It is from the Ethiopians,” says he,
“that the Egyptians learned to honour their kings as gods, to bury
their dead with so much pomp; and their sculpture and their writing
(hieroglyphics) had their origin in Ethiopia.”[18]

SCULPTURE IN ONE OF THE PYRAMIDS OF MEROE.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The following is a description of the most important pieces of
sculpture which I found on the walls of the porticoes. (Plate X.
Sculpture.—Meroe.)

The principal figure in this plate is a queen, plainly attired in
a long robe, tight at the neck and ankles, and, what is not usual
in Egyptian sculpture, closely fitted to the legs. The whole figure
is singularly dissimilar to those represented in the sculptures of
Egypt. It is strongly marked by corpulency, a quality still so desired
by Eastern beauties; a curious circumstance, since this rotundity of
form, which is the distinguishing feature of Ethiopian sculpture, and
which, making its figures more bulky, and, perhaps, clumsy, than the
Egyptian, is nevertheless rather pleasing to the eye, and, I think,
more natural. I made this drawing with the camera lucida, in order to
give the figure exactly, without any exaggeration. It will be observed
that there are defects in the proportions, similar and as numerous
as in Egyptian sculpture; for instance, the faulty manner of drawing
the eye, the shortness of the arms, and the form not being fully
made out. This queen has in one hand the lash of Osiris, and in the
other a lotus flower. She is on the seat having the form of a lion,
which differs very little from the one we often see on the walls of
the temples of Egypt. Her sandals greatly resemble some specimens I
have seen at Thebes, and are not unlike those the peasants here now
wear. She is seated under a canopy, the top of which is decorated
with the common Egyptian ornament of the heads and necks of serpents.

Opposite to her have been placed three rows of figures, the first
of which is quite destroyed; the second is injured, but sufficiently
entire to render all the hieroglyphics and figures intelligible. The
first represents a female pouring out libations to the queen. The
vase into which the liquid is represented as falling has a shape
which I have never seen in Egypt. This figure has the same rotundity
of form, though, from the small scale, it is less conspicuous in
my drawing. Behind this are six smaller figures or divinities. The
first, from his attributes, and also the hieroglyphics, is the god
Thoth, with both hands raised. The next is Horus, with two vases
in his hands, from one of which he is apparently pouring water
upon plants in two vases, on a stand which has nearly the form
of a lotus-flower. Anubis is the next divinity, and he also has a
vase in his hand. On one side of this latter figure is a vase, and
on the other the lotus flower-stand. After these figures is Kneph,
behind whom is a rude and ugly-shaped vase: then follow two figures
very much defaced. From the hieroglyphics, one of them must be Seb,
but those of the other I am not acquainted with. The only figure
discernible in the third row is Anubis, pouring libations. This
plate then exhibits four of the divinities generally represented in
the judgment-scenes and mysteries of the dead. Thoth, Horus, Anubis,
and Kneph present offerings to the queen, the occupant of the tomb.

The consideration of the hieroglyphics of this and the other
sculptures on the tombs of Meroe I will defer until another
opportunity; only remarking, that the composition of the groups is
rather inferior to that in the Egyptian edifices, and that the names
in the ovals are unknown. I must also state that it appears to me
that there is the name of Meroe in the last row of the tablet, before
the queen. There is the hieroglyphic of three hills, emblematical
of land; the plough and the disk, which, with the vowels generally
omitted, may be read, land of Mero, or, in Coptic, Ⲙⲉ ⲢⲎ,
“dilectus Sol,” not an inappropriate name. I have an imperfect
drawing (given me by Sir William Gell) of a coin found by Mr. Ruppell,
on one side of which is a boat and the three long lines, emblematical
of the inundation. Above the boat are, apparently, the same two
hieroglyphics of the plough and disk, which I conceive to be the
name of the capital of Ethiopia.

SCULPTURE IN THE PORTICO OF A PYRAMID AT MEROE.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

Plate XI. This exhibits a subject more interesting. There has
seemingly been a figure, similar to the queen (in Plate X.), on a
lion-formed seat, but it is now too much defaced to discover exactly
whether it has been a king or a queen. The style of the sculpture
is, however, evidently Ethiopian. The centre of this group, also,
is divided into three rows. The highest contains a representation
similar to part of the great procession in the portico of Medenet
Abou, at Thebes. In this interesting little fragment we have a proof
that the Egyptians derived even their religious ceremonies from the
Ethiopians. Although this row of figures is exceedingly injured,
I distinguished clearly the jackal, ibis, and hawk standards,
carried by priests shaved, and with long robes, like those in the
procession at Medenet Abou; thus confirming what Diodorus says,
that “the priests in Ethiopia observe the same order and the same
customs as the Egyptians. Those who are devoted to the worship
of the gods purify themselves, shave, and dress, in the same
manner.” Following these standard-bearers is a curious figure
of Anubis and four priests bearing a boat, but almost defaced. I
cannot agree with those who suppose that this procession alludes
to the expeditions of the Ethiopians, undertaken at the command of
their oracle, or that it is as Heeren calls it the oracle ship. I
consider it rather a religious type, emblematical of the passage of
the soul into immortality; the voyage to “the undiscovered land,
from whose bourne no traveller returns.”

In the same row of this plate we have Isis, Osiris, Horus, and
Thoth. The addition of the two former is important, when we consider
that they are in a real Ethiopian edifice. Osiris is represented, as
at Thebes, as president of Amenti, under the figure of a mummy; his
lash in his hand, and the head-dress of the globe and feathers, &c.

In the third row, Isis, with the head-dress of the hieroglyphic
called the throne, is caressing a hawk on a pedestal; the type of
her son Horus. The third row contains a variety of elegant vases. We
have here the true origin of many that were once thought Greek, and
only recently acknowledged to be Egyptian. The large figure, offering
with one hand a vase of incense, and with the other pouring libations,
is remarkable for his short girdle, made of the skin of a lion. This
is another proof of the originality of the style. The common Egyptian
and Ethiopian lion-formed seat had also, very probably, its origin
here, where lions abounded. If in Egypt now, so thinly inhabited
(compared to what it formerly was), there are none of these animals,
it cannot be supposed that they existed there when the population was
so much denser. Diodorus says, that, as there was no wool in Ethiopia,
the inhabitants covered their nakedness with the skins of beasts;
and the Ethiopians, under Arsamenes (Herod. vii. 69.), are described
as clothed with the skins of panthers and lions. Strabo also says
that some of them only wear a cincture of skins, the sheep being
without wool. The ornament at the bottom of this plate is unique,
representing serpents standing erect, with arms and hands, in which
they are each holding a feather, the symbol of truth. I have never
seen this representation in Egypt, but it reminds me of some of the
subjects in the tombs of the kings. The ornament at the top of this
plate, representing stars, that is, the heavens, is constantly seen
in Egypt, and is also, seemingly, of Ethiopian derivation.

SCULPTURE IN A PYRAMID AT MEROE.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

Plate XII. (the third of Sculpture) represents the inner tablet,
or the three rows of figures, in a subject upon the opposite wall,
and is connected with the fragments of two figures, and adorned with
decorations defaced, but apparently so precisely the same as Plate
XI. that I have thought it unnecessary to repeat them. The smaller
figures in this subject are also less perfect. In the first row is
the fragment of a figure certainly meant for Osiris; before him may be
distinguished four very small divinities, perhaps the genii of Amenti,
and a lion, seated on a pedestal, the executioner of justice. In the
same row is a curious group of four hogs. I have been told that a
representation of these animals once existed on a tomb at Thebes; but
this is the first time I have seen them sculptured on any edifice in
the valley of the Nile. In the second row is a pedestal, upon which
is the model of a monolithic temple. On one side of the latter is a
goose, and on the other a hawk, emblematical of the divinities Seb
and Horus; after which there is a representation of a tree, with
a figure on each side, followed by Thoth, with his hands raised
towards the figure of a mummy: the head of the latter is defaced;
but its shape is important, as proving that the Ethiopians were
acquainted with the art of embalming. The third row contains a
pedestal, or altar, on which three figures are seated. One with the
globe and horns is Isis; the third, Horus; the other, is defaced:
behind these is a large twisted serpent. In the second row of this
tablet, and also in Plate XI., is an altar or pedestal, on which
are cakes of bread, and in the midst of them the flowers of the
lotus; indicating, I conceive, that they are the bread of that
plant. The figure with a ceinture of lion’s skin, in both these
subjects, is pouring libations on the flowers, symbolical, perhaps,
of the reign of the king, who, like the inundation of the river,
had spread abundance and prosperity over the land. There were some
other fragments on the porticoes, and in one I observed a balance,
and Thoth and Horus weighing the actions of the deceased before the
judge, Osiris; a common subject on the papyrus, and which is also
seen on the walls of the Temple of Athor at Thebes, &c.

At the extremity of each portico, as before observed, is the
representation of a monolithic temple, above which are the traces
of a funeral boat filled with figures, but all too defaced to be
distinctly made out. In the centre of each boat is the sphere in
the usual concave socket; and I was able, with much difficulty, to
distinguish the divinities Kneph and Anubis. On each side of the boat
is a pedestal on which is the bird with a human face representing
the soul: one has a sphere on its head. Diodorus mentions that some
of the Ethiopians preserved the bodies of their relations in glass
(probably alabaster) cases, in order to have them always before
their eyes. These porticoes may have been used to contain such cases.

I have carefully described this interesting and magnificent cemetery;
but how shall I attempt to express the feelings of the traveller on
treading such hallowed ground? One who, in passionate admiration for
the arts, had visited the chief galleries of Europe, gazed upon the
breathing image of divinity in the Apollo of the Vatican, or the deep
expression of the most poetical of statues, the Dying Gladiator of the
Capitol; who had beheld and felt the pictorial creations of a Raphael
and a Correggio, and, with delight, contemplated Grecian, Roman,
and modern sculpture, could not be unmoved at finding himself on the
site of the very metropolis where those arts had their origin. The
traveller who has seen the architectural antiquities of Rome, and
has admired the magnificent use that nation has made of the arch,
making it the chief ornament of their baths, palaces, and temples,
would be further deeply interested at finding here the origin of that
discovery. These emotions would be felt with peculiar force by one
who, like myself, had been fortunate enough to trace art through her
earliest creations,—from the splendid Gothic edifices of the north
to the ruins of the Eternal City—from Rome to Magna Græcia—from
the magnificent Temple of Neptune at Pæstum to the still purer
antiquities of Sicily, particularly at Girgenti, where nature and art
seem to have vied with each other—from that interesting island to
the Morea and the city of Minerva, where the knowledge of the arts,
sown in the most genial soil, produced the perfection of elegance,
chasteness, and magnificence. But the seeds of the knowledge of the
Greeks were derived from Egypt; and the Egyptians received their
civilisation from the Ethiopians, and from Meroe, where I now am
writing. The beautiful sepulchres of that city afford satisfactory
evidence of the correctness of the historical records. Where a
taste for the arts had reached to such perfection, we may rest
assured that other intellectual pursuits were not neglected, nor
the sciences entirely unknown. Now, however, her schools are closed
for ever, without a vestige of them remaining. Of the houses of her
philosophers, not a stone rests upon another; and where civilisation
and learning once reigned, ignorance and barbarism have reassumed
the sway.

These pyramids are of sandstone, the quarries of which are in the
range of hills to the east. The stone is rather softer than the
Egyptian, which, added to the great antiquity, may account for the
very dilapidated state of most of these ruins; and also for the
sculpture and hieroglyphics being so defaced. Time, and the burning
rays of a tropical sun, have given them a brownish red tint, in some
parts nearly black. As the operation of many ages is required to
make this change on a light-coloured sandstone, a further proof is
afforded of the great antiquity of the monuments. The stones being
small, and easily removed, it is fortunate that the chief group of
pyramids is so far distant from the Nile; otherwise, like those on
the plain, near the river, a great proportion of them might have been
carried away as materials for the erection of more modern edifices.

This, then, is the Necropolis, or City of the Dead. But where was
Meroe, its temples and palaces? A large space, about 2000 feet in
length, and the same distance from the river, strewed with burnt
brick and with some fragments of walls, and stones similar to those
used in the erection of the pyramids, formed, doubtless, part of
that celebrated site. The idea that this is the exact situation
of the city is strengthened by the remark of Strabo, that the
walls of the habitations were built of bricks: Εν δε ταις πολεσιν αἱ
οικησεις εκ φοινικινων σχιζων διαπλεκομεναι και τοιχων εκ
πλινθων. These indicate, without doubt, the site of that
cradle of the arts which distinguish a civilised from a barbarous
society. Of the birthplace of the arts and sciences, the wild natives
of the adjacent villages have made a miserable burying-place:
of the city of the learned—its “cloud-clapt towers,” its
“gorgeous palaces,” its “solemn temples,” there is “left
not a rack behind.” The sepulchres alone of her departed kings
have fulfilled their destination of surviving the habitations which
their philosophy taught them to consider but as inns, and are now fast
mouldering into dust. As at Memphis, scarcely a trace of a palace or
a temple is to be seen. In this once populous plain I saw the timid
gazelles fearlessly pasturing. The hyenas and wolves abound in the
neighbouring hills. This morning Signor B. met a man with the head
of one which he was carrying in triumph to his village: he said
that he had been attacked at once by three small ones when alone,
and with no weapon but his lance. The small villages of Bagromeh[19],
south of the ruins, consist of circular cottages with thatched conical
roofs. The peasants have numerous flocks, which they send to pasture
on the plain. On the banks of the river I observed cotton, dourah,
and barley. Such is the present state of Meroe. It is an ample
requital for my toilsome journey, to have been the first to bring
to England accurate architectural drawings, &c. of all the remains
of the ancient capital of Ethiopia, that city which will ever live
in the grateful recollection of those who love the arts.

_March 6._ My rais informed me, this morning, that he could wait
no longer; that his orders from the Mahmoor were only to show us
the ruins; that he knew the governor wanted the boat; and that he
would not stay another night on any consideration. I should have
wished to have remained a few days more at this interesting place,
particularly with the view of making some excavations, but I must
confess I had no great hopes of the latter being of much avail. Since
the enterprising French traveller, M. Cailliaud was here, the desert
must have made great encroachments on the ruins in the plain, as I
saw nothing of the traces and almost plan, of a temple which he has
marked in his General Plate, No. XXXI.

It will be alleged that there are a great many discrepancies between
my architectural and picturesque views and those of M. Cailliaud. I
have only to remark that the former are by M. Bandoni, a most
skilful Italian architect and painter of acknowledged reputation,
whose sufficient recommendation to me was the patronage of that
most distinguished of British antiquarians, Sir William Gell. The
picturesque views are drawn by myself, with the utmost care and
attention, and with the camera lucida; so that I can vouch for the
correct position of every stone. M. Cailliaud has given several
pieces of sculpture from the propylons. I observed that the façades
of two of the porticoes were ornamented with sculpture, representing
a king sacrificing prisoners—a subject so often seen in Egypt:
they were very much injured; but had they struck me as being so
extraordinary as he has represented them, I should certainly have
drawn them separately. The figure which appears in my camera view
(Plate IX.) has none of those peculiarities. The variations in the
directions of the pyramids are most accurately marked; for I was very
particular in my directions to Mr. B. on that subject. M. Cailliaud
has left me the opportunity of being the first to present to the
public several interesting pieces of sculpture, and numerous tablets
which decorate the interior of the porticoes.

At five P.M., I left, with great regret, the site of Meroe, and
stopped for the night at half past seven. The navigation of the river,
in the dark, at this season of the year, is dangerous, on account
of the number of rocks. We have passed, this evening, the village
of Abukatab, to the west, and on the east a large village called
Kabushish, and an island of the same name. We passed Garburiah, a
large village to the west, and we are now near El Gililife, a smaller
one on the same side. Yesterday, and this morning, I was greatly
alarmed for the health of my Dragoman. He has had a most violent
dysentery, which I have at last cured with opium and calomel; the
former sufficiently strong to keep him asleep. This attack might have
been fatal to him had he not possessed a very strong constitution.

_March_ 7. We set sail this morning, at six, with a favourable wind,
and passed, at nine, a large village called Meroueer, on the west
side. The resemblance to the ancient name is obvious, but there are
no remains. At ten we passed the village of Sofra, to the west; at
half past ten, the village of Gaher, same side, and the small island
of Addadiker. Shortly afterwards, we passed the village of Unukatab,
and arrived at Shendy at twelve.

[Illustration: FORTIFIED RESIDENCE OF THE ANCIENT MELEKS, OR KINGS,
OF SHENDY.]

_Shendy._—On the eastern banks of the river is one of the old
fortified houses of the Meleks, now the residence of the government. I
called to pay my respects to the Katshef, but was informed that he
was asleep. I proceeded to the town, which is about a mile distant
from the river. Burckhardt, by his very detailed account of Shendy,
conveys almost an impression that it is a considerable place; but,
though the capital of a once important province, that succeeded to
all that remains of the commerce of Meroe, as a city it can never have
been worthy of much notice. Any of the little towns in Lower and Upper
Egypt have ten times more the appearance of a metropolis. The houses
are little better than mere hovels; there are no shops, no _cafés_:
the country in the immediate vicinity is wretchedly barren. The
town may now contain 600 or 700 houses, and not more than 3000 or
3500 inhabitants. The dwellings are not crowded together, as in the
villages of Egypt; they are spacious, and have often interior courts:
the streets are wide, and there are in the town several open spaces,
or squares, some of which are used as market-places.

It fortunately happened to be the day of the bazaar, which gave me
an opportunity of seeing what articles were exposed for sale, and
also of observing the Arabs and peasants who attend the market. The
most valuable articles offered for sale were camels, dromedaries,
and slaves. The price of a male negro is from 10 to 20 dollars: they
are preferred young, being then more docile and less lethargic than
at a maturer age. Female slaves, when old, are valued according to
their acquirements: when young, being destined for the harem, they
rank according to their personal attractions, and vary from 30 to
100 dollars. Abyssinians, when young and beautiful, as they often
are, bring from 60 to 100 dollars. Camels were selling for 9 and 10
dollars each,—the best, 12 and 14; dromedaries, 12 and 20; and even
50 dollars for a high-bred Bishareen. There was a great show of oxen
with humps on their shoulders, like those of ancient Egypt, as they
are always represented on the walls. (See the one in the view of a
Dongolah cottage, Plate XXXVI.) There were also sheep and goats in
the bazaar: the sheep, 6 to 9 piastres (1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ 3_d._),
skin included. The price of the goats, if they yield much milk, 10
piastres (2_s._ 6_d._). I remarked several peasants selling a coarse
common kind of goat’s-milk cheese, for which there is apparently
a great demand. The Cairo merchants bring a variety of articles:
white cotton dresses; cutlery of a very inferior quality, such as
twopenny knives, or razors, which sell here for fivepence; soap;
Abyssinian coffee (very good); beads; shells; small glass mirrors;
kohl (antimony), to tint their eyelids, and hennah to colour the
hands of the swarthy beauties; and a variety of spices and essences.

Their manner of dealing is peculiar. When I asked the price of a
camel (for I thought of buying some for my journey homewards), they
would not name one, but asked me how much I would give. I made an
offer for a dromedary to a man, who refused it, but still declined
saying how much he would demand. I soon gave up such a tedious
process of making a bargain. I observed some good specimens of the
Shendyan beauties. (See Plate XVI.) They have their hair twisted in
tresses and hanging down on each side of their faces; their dress is
of coarse materials, but flowing, graceful, and generally adjusted
with much taste and elegance.

A WOMAN OF SHENDY.

MOUSSA. Son of a Melek of Berber.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

Shendy, Berber, Dar Shageea, Dongolah, &c., previous to their
submission to the Pasha, had each its own Melek, independent or
tributary to the great Melek of Sennaar. Each of the sons of these
petty kings had estates assigned to him; but they all acknowledged
the head of the family, that is, the reigning Melek, contributed
to his support and defence, submitted to his laws and commands,
and served him in war. This order of Meleks, or nobles, was most
numerous; and they established their power by the same base system
alluded to in my account of Berber, and to which I refer with
reluctance, as developing the means by which the Meleks obtained
political influence in this part of the interior of Africa. Such a
profligate, and, fortunately, unique system of family aggrandisement
tended obviously to the complete demoralisation of the country. They
purchased, or made captive in their wars, female slaves; of which
some possessed thirty, others as many as a hundred, and some five
hundred. These unfortunate creatures, as already stated, were placed
by the meleks in the different villages, and obliged to gratify the
avarice of their masters, and earn their own scanty livelihood by the
abandonment of their virtue. The only privilege these most wretched
of slaves possess is, that when they have paid to the melek a sum
equal to their purchase money or present value, the custom of the
country precludes him from selling them. It is at his option to
sell or not the child to the father. The price of the infant is
generally from 150 to 200 piastres. The daughters, when grown up,
succeed to their mother’s “heritage of woe.” The compulsion
under which these victims act is some apology for this systematic
depravity. They pride themselves as superior to the common almæ,
and are not considered in the same light by the virtuous women in the
village, who never admit the almæ into their houses, or hold any
intercourse with them. These slaves, on the contrary, are not only
permitted to visit them and join in their occupations and festivals,
but are admitted to their friendship. They are allowed to be present
at their wedding and funeral ceremonies, though not to join in the
dance. The sons of these slaves, as already noticed, are sometimes
sold, particularly when the melek is in want of money; but generally
they are brought up to cultivate the ground of their chief, and, when
necessity requires, rally around his standard, and accompany him to
battle. From their earliest infancy, they are entirely devoted to
the despotic will of their melek; evincing great attachment to his
person, and zeal in the execution of his commands, as the only means
by which they can hope for emancipation. This singular kind of family
connection may, perhaps, account for the supreme authority in this
country having been so seldom disturbed, and for the rare occurrence
of those revolutions so common in such petty uncivilised states. The
result of the system was, that the melek had always a large force
of slaves and dependants, besides those of the meleks his kinsmen,
who were also implicitly devoted to his will, and deeply interested
in maintaining the peace and security of the kingdom.

The meleks were the only aristocracy of the country. Each, before the
Pasha’s domination, took four wives; and many, regardless of the
limit set by the Koran, even more. They tell me that Melek Tumbol of
Argo has had twenty-one.[20] Their wives, who are always daughters
of meleks, pass their time in the harem; for it is considered a
degradation to have a son by a slave or woman of low rank, or to
allow their wives to work. The Pasha, by depressing the meleks, has
diminished, but not destroyed, this system of slavery; and at some
future period it may be the means of exciting a combined effort to
expel his descendants. Serving, as some of the Shageea slaves do,
in his army, they have, of course, learned the use of fire-arms, and
could turn them against their oppressors. There are 500 of the Shageea
tribe in the pay of the Pasha. But, perhaps aware that the security
of their dominion over this country consists in their discipline,
and the superiority of their arms, the government have not admitted
into their army any of the Arab tribes of this vicinity; and these
Shageeas being at a distance, near Habeesh, little danger is to be
apprehended from them now: indeed, so long as they are so far distant
with the army, they may be considered as hostages for the fidelity
of their province. Hourshid Bey, the governor of Sennaar, besides
the 500 Shageea slaves, has also under his command nearly 5000 men,
consisting of Mograbins, from Lower Egypt, Fellaheen, and Turks. With
this force, he extends every campaign the Pasha’s dominion on the
Blue River, and sends every year never less than 500, and often as
many as 3000 slaves, the trophies of his victories, to Cairo.

Before the conquest of Ismael Pasha, Shendy, I understand, was rather
more populous: but this was the town where that unfortunate prince
met his fate. The circumstances connected with this event, according
to the information I obtained here, differ, in some respects, from
those which have been stated by other travellers. It might seem that
the accounts obtained by those who passed immediately after his death
were likely to be most correct: but often the contrary is the case;
for events in the course of time have new light thrown upon them, and
the rashness and imprudence of Ismael Pasha were naturally glossed
over at the moment. He came from Sennaar to Shendy with about ten
Mamelukes. The Meleks Nimr (tiger) of Shendy, and Messayad of Metammah
(a eunuch who once belonged to Sultan Foddal of Darfour), came to
pay their homage to him. The Pasha demanded of Nimr a subsidy, to
the value of 100,000 dollars, in money, slaves, and cattle: Nimr,
in no very polite terms, declared his inability, when the Pasha,
in a fit of passion, struck him with his pipe. Nimr, enraged at this
insult, was on the point of drawing his sabre and attacking the Pasha;
but Melek Messayad pacified him, advising him, in the dialect of the
Bishareen, which they both understood, to delay his revenge until
evening, and at present to promise a compliance with the exorbitant
requisition. The two chiefs, after leaving the presence, ordered their
slaves and people to prepare a quantity of wood. The Khasnar Dar Bey
of the Pasha observed these preparations, and was overheard by an
Arab advising the Prince to effect his escape: but the latter, with
the pride peculiar to the Turks, replied, “Am I not a Pasha? and
what Arab dare touch me?” A few hours after dark, they surrounded
the house with faggots, set fire to them, and the unfortunate Prince
and the Mamelukes who were with him perished in the flames. Nimr
fled up the country, married a daughter of a king of Habeesh, and
is still the inveterate enemy of the Turks. The same night Melek
Messayad fell upon the few troops that were stationed at Metammah,
and massacred them. Messayad was afterwards killed by the Deftar Dar
Bey, as were also a great number of the Shendyans, suspected to be
connected with the murder of the Prince. In consequence of this event,
the government have made Metammah, on the opposite side of the river,
their chief place of residence, and several of the inhabitants of
Shendy have removed thither.

Metammah, situated one hour’s walk from the river, is a much
more desolate-looking place than even Shendy. You see streets full
of sand, scarcely an inhabitant, no _brio_, no bazaar: the houses
are common hovels. Such are the present capitals of Ethiopia. The
only habitable abode is one of the fortified castles of the Sheakhs,
now occupied by a Katshef, who commands this part of the province. I
paid him a visit, but found him a stupid fellow, and could procure
no information from him on any subject, especially concerning the
locality of the antiquities in the desert I was anxious to visit. His
house presented a complete contrast to that of the governor of
Berber, being filthy in the extreme, so that I was almost afraid to
sit down on his divan. The servants who presented the coffee were
the most wretchedly dressed fellows I have seen in the country. The
conversation was chiefly about backsheesh (presents), and the spirit
they exhibited, in discussing the prices of the camels I required for
my journey into the desert, was very disgusting. The Katshef’s son
entered the room, and fired off an English pistol at the window,—a
Turkish hint that another pistol would be acceptable. The Katshef
asked me to stop and dine with him; but really the appearance of
the place was not sufficiently promising to induce me to accept his
offer. He ordered me a horse to convey me back to my tent, and gave
me a dirty scoundrel as a guide who did not know the road. The moon
had not risen; and, it being extremely dark, we missed the track
in crossing the plain: fortunately, the light of a fire, which I
knew came from a hut near my boat, served me as a guide. The horse,
several times, nearly fell, in consequence of the roughness of the
ground. On arriving at my tent, I gave the urchin three piastres,
with which he was not satisfied, although the clothes, or rather rags,
on his back were not worth half the sum.

_March_ 8. I returned this morning to Shendy, and waited on the
Katshef, an old retired officer, not now in the employ of the
Pasha; but, having been useful in his day, he receives his pay, and
lives here in good style. He gave us an excellent dinner: the most
remarkable dish was a preparation of meat with _raib_, a kind of sour
milk, which is very refreshing in this climate; he also assisted us in
making the necessary preparations for our excursion into the desert.

March 9. We left Shendy later than we intended, having been delayed by
the following little difficulties. I had engaged from the government
six camels, with three drivers, of which they only sent me one driver.
As I found I should lose a day, or perhaps two, in going back to
Metammah, and there were said to be none procurable here, I was forced
to yield this point. I had also stipulated for a Turkish soldier, who
accompanied Cailliaud, and for a habeer (guide), and had agreed to give
twelve piastres per day for these two persons. Before setting out, I
asked the soldier, “where was the habeer?” “I am the habeer,” he said.
“Where, then,” asked I, “is the soldier?” “Oh,” said he, “I am soldier
and habeer both.” I was resolved not to start without another, my own
men not being sufficient to load the camels. After a long dispute,
he at length procured me an Arab. This is a specimen of the little
annoyances to which travellers are generally liable in dealing with
Turks. The desert to-day has had the appearance of a shrubbery, being
richly covered with long yellow grass, acacias, tamarinds, and thorns,
and enlivened with numerous herds of gazelles. Every two or three
minutes we saw six or eight, but so wild that our attempts to approach
them were fruitless.

_Ruins of Wady Owataib, or Mecaurat.—March_ 10. We started this
morning at six, and at eleven arrived at these interesting ruins. We
passed, at about nine, a range of soft sandstone hills, which run
from east to west.

I was surprised to find in this situation, which may be called the
interior of the Desert, such extensive remains of antiquity. They
consist of an edifice, containing temples, courts, corridors,
&c. destined for purposes not religious only, but civil, domestic,
or military. After taking a general survey, I returned to my tent
for my portfolio, pencils, &c. My dragoman met me, with a bewildered
look, and communicated to me intelligence which was any thing but
agreeable. A man, who was driving cattle, the only person we have
met to-day, came and asked my servants, who were pitching the tent,
if they were not afraid of lions, as they seemed to be preparing
to pass the night amongst the ruins. He told them that he brought
his cattle here to pasture only during the day, when the lions are
asleep in their dens among the mountains, but through the night
they prowl all over this part of the plain; and only six nights
ago four of them had killed three of his cattle, within 200 yards
of our tent. He showed them the spot where their bones lay, and
advised us immediately to quit this place, and remove either to the
Nile, or to a distant mountain, whither he was going, and where we
should be in safety. These tidings caused no slight consternation
in my little caravan; some repented having come, others wished to
return immediately; all seemed dismayed at the idea of passing the
night exposed to such unpleasant visiters. Was I then to leave the
antiquities of Meroe, and abandon the hope of being able to procure
any further memorials of their magnificence? There were only two
alternatives: to return with the mortification of having failed in
one of the great objects of my journey, and still, as we could not
arrive before night, perhaps incur the same danger; or to take the
necessary precautions for defence in case of being attacked by these
animals. I chose the latter course, and made my men collect all the
wood that could be found, to keep up fires during the night. I sent
my dragoman and the Turkish soldier towards the neighbouring hills,
to see if they could discover any traces of them. After an hour they
returned, and said they had seen none. The fact was, my dragoman did
not know their footprints, and the Turk concealed the truth. Scarcely
had I finished an address to my artist and servants, endeavouring
to assure them that, after this intelligence, we should, with proper
precautions, be perfectly safe, when, looking down, I perceived, in
my very tent, the distinct traces of a lion; but I put my foot upon
them, and said nothing. I could discover no other marks about the
ruins; but a very light wind is sufficient to efface the impression
on a loose sandy desert like this. This evening I have established
a watch, and kept it myself five hours. My servants are sleeping on
the ground, according to their custom, and have taken the precaution
to form the camels into a sort of fortification, by tying them down
in a circle round themselves. They are now all sleeping soundly,
unconscious of danger, except my habeer, who has fastened the heel
of his camel to his own leg, knowing well that the instinct of that
creature (trembling and restive whenever a lion is near) will warn
him of danger, and at the same time the animal will be prevented
from flying off and escaping without his master.

_March_ 11. I had not been long asleep, during the watch of my
servants and artist, when I was suddenly roused. The Turk had seen two
lions among the ruins, within 100 yards of my tent, and had fired his
gun to frighten them away. I immediately ordered additional fires
to be lighted: shortly afterwards, the peasant, who had advised
us against encamping here, came to us for protection. By the light
of the moon he had perceived the approach of two lions, which, he
said, were behind him in the plain. I went a short distance from
my tent, with the Turk, to reconnoitre, and I heard them roaring
at no considerable distance. The roar soon became very distinct,
even in my tent, but it did not prevent my falling asleep, as I was
dreadfully fatigued by the previous day’s work, the long watch I
had made, and the excessive heat. This was yesterday extraordinary
for the season, being 110° in the shade (of the temple), though the
extreme has been hitherto 98° and 100°. I slept the remainder of
the night. This morning we found that the four lions had rambled all
over the ruins, and their traces were quite fresh in every part. They
had evidently been deterred only by our fires from attacking us. I
ascertained them, by their footsteps, to be two males and two females;
one of the males must have been very large, the females much smaller.

Every place and country has its danger, but few spread more alarm
than this terror of the deserts. Seas and oceans have their tempests,
in which vessels are frequently shipwrecked; and, even in smooth
water, rocks and shoals send many to a watery grave. The traveller,
even on the king’s high road, has sometimes to dread banditti. How
many accidents occur even to the citizen on his holyday trips! Thus
he who has never quitted his native country, and the traveller
in foreign lands, are alike beset with perils; but there are few
dangers which cannot be alleviated, often prevented, by prudent and
precautionary measures, and which, stripped of the terrors in which
heated imaginations have clothed them, present in their reality much
that is alarming. By simply keeping up a few fires, the merchants
who pass these deserts sleep securely, in defiance of their being
infested by the most formidable of all wild beasts. I should, however,
state, that instances are mentioned of fires not having this effect,
when the lions are excessively pressed by hunger, particularly at the
season when they require food for their young. Towards evening (for
it is very seldom, if ever, that the lion is seen during the day),
one alone has often arrested a large caravan. In some instances they
have been known to attack men; but are generally content with an ox
or a camel, which they kill, and sometimes, particularly if they
have left their females or young in their den, carry away a large
part on their shoulders. The number of these animals must increase
rapidly every year, for it is very seldom that an instance occurs
of one being killed.

They tell me, that a party of twenty peasants went lately to destroy
two which had taken a station within a very short distance of the
river, and committed great ravages among the flocks. The men were
armed with lances, shields, and sabres. They traced the lions to
their den, and began lighting fires, to drive them out. The female
darted past them immediately. The male remained some time, until he
could no longer endure the smoke, when he began to roar in a most
terrific manner; he then rushed out, infuriated, upon the peasants:
not one, however, of these gallant assailants had the courage to
fling his lance, but each, without any consideration for the fate of
his friends, sought his own security in flight. Fire-arms only are of
use against these formidable animals, but the Italian proverb is said
to be true of them:—_Il lione ferito alla morte non s’avvilisce
ancora_. They are generally seen two and four together, often more,
but always in pairs. They are very rarely disturbed; and, as no
attempts have been made to exterminate them, their number is said
to have increased considerably during these last few years. This
may be considered the place where their haunts begin. They infest
the road to Sennaar and the west side of the Atbara; but travellers
incur less danger in the beaten track of the caravans than when,
like us, they deviate from it.

The reader will recollect that, at the entrance of this desert,
I observed great numbers of gazelles, but for several miles round
these ruins and hills I saw none. These timid creatures prefer the
risk of approaching the habitations of man, considering the arts of
the peasants to destroy them less perilous than the vicinity of the
lions. The latter know the places in the plain where the gazelles
sleep, and, favoured by the darkness of night, dart upon their
victims, whose superior swiftness only avails them when sometimes the
roaring of their enemy intimates his approach. The Arabs tell some
singularly superstitious tales of the generosity of the lion. The
following has been related to me as a fact, by different peasants; but
I must confess that, like the generality of Arab tales, it partakes
of the marvellous: yet, perhaps, with a _mélange_ of fable, there
may be some kind of foundation of truth. They say, that when the lion
seizes the cow of a peasant, he will permit the owner to carry away
a portion; particularly if he asks for it in the name of his mother,
wife, or family, _and takes it without showing any fear_.—I must
apologise to the antiquarian, and perhaps to readers in general,
for this long digression from my description of these antiquities,
but I promised to give some account, not only of the remains, but
also of the present inhabitants of Ethiopia.

The plan (see Plate XIII.) which I give of these ruins was made
with the utmost care by my artist, Mr. B., and drawn out on the
spot. I can testify for the pains that were taken to render it as
accurate as possible. The ruin is too much destroyed for the plan
to be perfectly correct, as to the size and situation of some of
the doors, and the dimensions of many of the apartments; still,
there is all that is necessary to exhibit to the reader the general
form of the edifice. Even if all the walls were remaining, without
any inscription to elucidate them, it would still be doubtful what
this extraordinary mass of building has been. The appearance of
the ruins is very imposing, from their immense extent; and I will
give a detailed description of them, as they are certainly the most
curious and inexplicable I have yet seen in Ethiopia. They consist
of chambers, courts, corridors, and temples, in an enclosure or
parallelogram, 760 by 660 feet; but in more accurate numbers the
entire circumference is 2854 feet. The north-east side is 660 feet
long; the north-west, the only side on which there are entrances,—

On the north-east, south-east, and south-west sides, there are no
entrances into the enclosure. The wall on the north-west side cannot
be traced accurately through its whole extent. There have apparently
been three entrances on this side; the central one, which is the most
distinguishable, leads into a large court, 620 feet wide and 144 feet
long. Opposite to the central entrance, on the south-east side of
the court, is a long narrow corridor, 8 feet wide and 205 feet long,
which leads to the principal temple, situated in a court 94 feet long
by 85 feet wide. To give an exact idea of the situation of this court,
I should state, that from the wall of the court to the enclosure on
the south-east side is 106 feet; 165 feet to the enclosure on the
south-west side; 204 feet from the north-west and 150 feet from the
north-east side. Although not exactly in the centre of the structure,
a slight examination of the plan will enable the reader to perceive
that, from its situation, size, and the circumstance of the corridors
leading into it, that edifice was, evidently, the principal temple:
it is 47 feet long, from north-west to south-east; and 40 feet
6 inches broad. The large court, and the corridor from it to the
temple, in a line with the central entrance of the enclosure, clearly
indicate that the grand entrance was on the west side; and yet it
is singular there is no doorway in the temple on that side. There
are five entrances into the latter; one on the south-east side,
two on the north-east, and two on the south-west. In front of the
south-east end have been twelve columns, three feet and a half in
diameter, in two rows of six each; before the west end, six columns,
and five at each side, not including the columns at the angles:
making, altogether, twenty-eight columns. There are the remains of
four columns, which ornamented the interior of the temple. In front
of it, on the south-east side, is a doorway which leads into a room
20 feet by 26, with two chambers on one side and one on the other;
before them is an inclined parapet: an architectural ornament to the
façades of temples, of which there are examples even in the best
style of Egyptian edifices, such as at Solib. (Plate XL.) The axis
of the door leading through this room to the parapet is the same as
that of the central edifice into the temple. The circumstance of this
inclined parapet wall, and there being a double row of columns only
at this end of the temple, prove that it fronted to the south-east.

The court containing the inclined parapet leading into the temple is
125 feet wide and 75 feet long: several doors lead out of it; one to
the east into a court of 96 feet long and 165 feet broad, in which is
a small temple fronting the south-west. A few rows of steps lead up to
a portico which was ornamented with four columns, fragments of which
are still remaining. On each side of the door leading from the portico
into the temple is a colossal statue, very much mutilated, being
now without either head or arms. They are attached to the wall in
the Egyptian manner, and they have the attitude of one foot advanced
before the other, like the Egyptians. The style of one is tolerably
good; the other, that is, the one on the east side of the doorway,
is much inferior. They are accurately represented in my drawing. The
exterior of this little temple is 53 feet by 45: at the angles is the
Egyptian beading. The doorway is ornamented with a twisted serpent
on each side. The interior, which consisted of one room, contains the
remains of two columns without their capitals. From their situation,
there appears to have been originally six: on the walls are some rude
scratches, but undoubtedly modern. South of the principal temple is a
large court, 258 feet long and 248 feet broad. On the north-east side
of the principal temple is a corridor 7 feet wide and 96 feet long,
having a north-west direction, whence it turns to the south-east for
45 feet, and leads into a court where there is another small temple:
this had also a portico before it, which was ornamented with four
columns. The exterior of this temple measures 52 feet by 29. In
the interior there are now the remains of four columns, from the
position of which there seem to have been originally eight. On the
south-west side of the principal temple is a corridor 86 feet long
and 12 feet wide, having a south-west direction, whence it turns
to the north-west for 20 feet, and leads to some small rooms, and
also into a large court 88 feet long, containing two small chambers,
in one of which are the fragments of three columns.

I will attempt no further description of this extraordinary
edifice. The reader will perceive, from the inspection of the
plan (Plate XIII.), how utterly impossible it is to give a more
detailed, and, at the same time, clear, description of its various
compartments. The confusion of successive rooms, corridors, small
and large courts, and temples, together with the total absence of any
attempt at regularity, excited my curiosity to find out the nature of
this singular construction. It has evidently been built by wretched
architects, at different periods, in an age when the art had sadly
declined in Ethiopia; but, before alluding to the different surmises
concerning the object of its erection, I will first give a detailed
description of the principal temple in the centre. The view (Plate
XIV.) will give a good idea of its present state of preservation. The
columns in Plates XIII., XIV., and vignette, executed architecturally,
will sufficiently indicate the style of art: a few fragments of
capitals alone remain, and those are on the north-east side of the
temple. It will be seen by Plate XIV. that the forms only of several
of the capitals are visible, but only one fragment has the appearance
of having been finished. (See vignette.) Their form is somewhat
similar to that usual in the Ptolemaic age of architecture in Egypt;
but the ornaments of the fragment, above alluded to, consist only of
parallel lines: whether these terminated in the lotus flower cannot
be ascertained, but there certainly is a resemblance, though not
complete, to a Ptolemaic capital. Under the capital of this column
are seven rows of beading; the rest of the shaft, consisting of five
pieces, is fluted, except the lowest stone, which is ornamented with
the lotus flower. The style of the fluting is Grecian. The shaft
swells out a little towards the lower part, and is rounded off at
the bottom. It bears another resemblance to the Egyptian style in
the base it rests upon being circular. There remains one fragment
(see vignette), of a fluted column with a smooth panel in the centre,
in which a wreath is sculptured in imitation of the leaves of the
palm tree. Another fragment of a column is ornamented with sculpture,
and at the base the triangular ornament not unlike the Egyptian.

[Illustration: COLUMNS AT WADY EL OWATAIB.]

The sculpture is in very high relief—not less than 1¾ inch; but
the style is decidedly bad: the figures are generally from about 3
to 4 feet in height; and, notwithstanding their defaced condition, I
could distinguish that some of them are _en face_; but the rudeness of
the execution of what remains perfect, demonstrates an epoch when the
arts had wofully degenerated in this their parent land. At Uffidunia,
in Lower Nubia, an edifice well known to be Roman, there is a piece
of sculpture on the detached propylon very much in this style. The
view (Plate XV.) represents fortuitously almost all the most perfect
fragments which now exist; and so completely shows the style of
the sculpture, that I regretted the less not having time to make
separate drawings, particularly as not a single hieroglyphic remains,
or has ever existed, to elucidate the sculpture. I trust, therefore,
that the accurate notes I took on the spot, of every fragment I
could find, and the specimens of the style in my drawings, will be
considered quite sufficient. What sculpture remains, is chiefly on
the lower part of two columns and on several fragments which lie
scattered about: some of the figures are _en face_, and some _en
profile_. Notwithstanding their defaced condition, I distinguished
the following:—Thriphis with the lion’s head, _en profile_;
the hawk-headed divinity (Horus); two figures, seemingly goddesses,
but not very discernible, _en face_; a divinity with a vase; Kneph,
_en face_, with a globe at his breast; a goddess, _en face_, in a
kind of monolithic temple. On another fragment I discerned a figure
presenting offerings with one hand, and the other raised behind
his head. On another large fragment, Isis, Horus, and a king were
discernible: the ovals of his name seem never to have been filled
up. On another fragment I observed a border consisting alternately
of a lion and the goddess of truth with outstretched wings. As there
are no hieroglyphics, the names of these divinities are, of course,
only inferred from the presence of their usual attributes. Except
on these fragments of columns in front of the central temple,
there are no other remains of sculpture in any part of these ruins,
with the exception of the two fragments of colossal statues I have
before alluded to as ornamenting the façades of the small temple
to the east. There are some other ruins at a short distance from the
great enclosure, but they are of little importance. One of the rooms
contains the remains of six columns, on one of which is sculptured
an elephant destroying a dog with his trunk, and on another a winged
lion is represented killing a man.

I have now only to advert to the singular situation of these ruins,
their probable use, and the age when they were most probably
erected. In a direct line, they are distant from the river six
hours’ journey, which may be sixteen or eighteen miles. About a
quarter of a mile from the ruin, I saw three or four blocks of stones,
but no indication of their having formed part of an aqueduct, and
there are no traces of wells; but both may have existed, and be now
entirely buried by the sand of the desert. I could not, however,
observe or hear of any decided traces of aqueducts between the
ruin and the river. The occupants of the edifice may have been
supplied with water by geerbahs, as the peasants of Metammah and
other villages distant from the river are at this day.[21] If
the edifice was only used as a residence during the season of the
malaria, the rain water might have been preserved in cisterns and
in the sacred lakes; but rain does not invariably fall here every
year, and would afford, therefore, only a precarious supply. Those,
however, who constructed such a building would certainly know how
to sink a well, and, from the appearance of the ground, the trees,
and the vicinity of the mountains, I do not conceive it would be a
very laborious undertaking to find water.

Cailliaud considered this edifice to have been a college of priests;
and Professor Heeren supposes it to be the celebrated Ammonium. I
think neither of these suppositions probable. With regard to
the first, we know that the priests were always surrounded with
representations of the divinities and the mysterious language of
hieroglyphics; but is it not remarkable that there is no structure
either in Egypt or Ethiopia so destitute of the sacred writing as
this? The priests, also, are supposed, with great probability, to
have themselves executed the sculpture and hieroglyphics; and they
cannot be imagined to have been unacquainted with that language. It
must, on the contrary, have formed a principal branch of their
education. I think it, therefore, very improbable that the place
where they would be occupied in teaching hieroglyphics should, of
all the ruins in the valley of the Nile, be the only one destitute
of them; that where instruction was given in the mysteries of their
religion, there should be so few representations of the gods, and
those few almost of no use to the student, from being unexplained
by hieroglyphics. One would imagine they would have gladly availed
themselves of the opportunity of the unoccupied walls to exercise
the skill of the students. If this were a college, their system of
education must assuredly have been very defective, if they did not
take care to have the mysteries they taught represented on the walls
of the universities, and not on those of the temples only. We must
consider the Ethiopians as ignorant indeed, if we suppose that they
neglected to place them where they would have been really useful,
while they covered with these subjects their temples, where they
would be less observed, and the interior of the porticoes of their
tombs, which were rarely opened. Had it been a college, some urchin
would have shown his progress in the study by carving his name in
hieroglyphics; and, considering that this was more the fashion with
the ancients than the moderns, we should have as long a list of
Ethiopian names _here_ as we have of English at Eton or Harrow. In
such a seminary, I conceive, the walls of the chambers, corridors, and
temples, inside and outside, like the temples and palaces of Egypt,
would have been decorated with sculpture. The walls are not rough,
but smooth and finished; it has therefore not been the original
intention to embellish them with such subjects.

Had this edifice, as Professor Heeren supposes, been the Ammonium,
the original seat of the oracle of Jupiter Ammon, at whose command
those religious colonies issued forth, which carried civilisation,
arts, and religion from Ethiopia to the Delta; had this been the
centre and stronghold of the superstitions of the Nile; the priests,
the guardians of the sacred rituals, would not have omitted to
decorate the abode of their great divinity with art and magnificence
proportionate to the wealth and power of so great a nation. Well
aware of the awe with which the appearance of mysterious learning
inspires the vulgar, they would not have neglected to adorn the walls
with imposing and mysterious subjects, to augment their veneration,
to excite them to devotion, and to munificence in their offerings to
the god. It accords in no degree with the religious pomp elsewhere
displayed by the Ethiopians and Egyptians, to conceive that this
unfinished and comparatively insignificant temple contained the golden
altar, the “holiest of holies,” of their great divinity. That
the great Ethiopian oracle, whose celebrity even Homer has testified,
should not have had a more magnificent habitation than this, cannot
be admitted. We know, from Pausanias and others, the costly presents
which were made to the oracles of Greece; and can we conceive that
the Ethiopians, probably equally, if not as more ancient, a much
more religious and superstitious people, would have allowed their
celebrated Ammonium to be the least finished, least magnificent
and imposing, of all the temples which now exist in the valley of
the Nile?

It is a more probable supposition that, as the wealth of the oracle
of Apollo at Delphi exposed it from the beginning to the enterprises
of avaricious and impious men, and was too powerful a temptation
even to the Phocians, in the same manner the great oracle of Ammon
in the valley of the Nile, particularly in a country like Ethiopia,
where history tells us that gold was once so plentiful, might suffer
from the celebrated altar which was dedicated to its worship being
loaded with the valuable and magnificent devotional offerings
of a wealthy and superstitious people. Such parade and splendour
would serve as incentives to the enemies of their religion, equally
anxious to appropriate the spoil and eradicate the superstitions of
the worshippers of Ammon. But it is most probable that, at the time
when the religion of the Gospel was widely spread in this part of
Africa, some Christian king of Ethiopia, zealous, and desirous of
obliging his subjects to embrace the true religion, and aware that,
if his faith prevailed at all, it must prevail, to use the language
of Paley, by the overthrow of every statue, altar, and temple in
the world, may have utterly destroyed not only the Ammonium, but
also many of the other temples; and this may account for the few
remains of sacred edifices which are now found in Ethiopia. Another
argument, in answer to the supposition of Professor Heeren, is, that,
among the numerous representations of the divinities on the columns
of the principal temples, there is not one single figure of Ammon,
except with the attributes of Kneph.

This edifice may have been a _château de chasse_ of the king, or a
palace in which he passed the rainy season, which might then, as now,
be unhealthy near the Nile. The objection to this supposition is,
that the kings as well as the priests were generally, and probably
always, surrounded with religious pomp and ceremony. I conceive it,
therefore, a more reasonable conjecture that it was an hospital, to
which invalids, particularly those suffering from malaria, were sent
during the rainy season. This will account for the immense courts and
chambers, and the insignificance of the temples, evidently intended
for persons of little consideration. From the experience I have
had of the climate of the desert, I must say I consider them much
more healthy, in any season, than the valley of the Nile. At the
instigation, I conceive, of some person acquainted with this fact,
the Pasha established a splendid hospital and college at Abou Zabel,
situated in the Desert, about twelve miles from Cairo. The dryness of
the atmosphere, the sand immediately absorbing any rain that falls,
renders these wildernesses in the highest degree salubrious. The
stones of which this edifice is constructed are nearly the same size
as those of the pyramids of Meroe; that is, about 1 foot high and 2½
feet long, and are apparently quarried from the neighbouring hills.

With regard to the antiquity of the ruins, it does not appear to me to
be very great. The sculpture, which, in the absence of hieroglyphics,
forms the only criterion, resembles, as already mentioned, that
on the propylons at Uffidunia; not exactly indicating that they
were built at the same period, but that they belonged equally to
the last stage of sculpture in the two countries; and, as the arts
first flourished in Ethiopia, they may have decayed there earlier
than in Egypt, particularly as the wealth and power of this country
diminished more rapidly, the Nile washing down to the lower valley
the source of their affluence and prosperity. From the Grecian
character of the fluting of the columns, as well as from the plan
of the temple and sculpture, it is not improbable that this edifice
was constructed about the period of Ergamenes, whose reign was coeval
with that of Ptolemy II. Diodorus describes this king of Ethiopia as
having had a Greek education, and having introduced into this his
native country a taste for the philosophy of Greece, and delivered
himself and his people from the tyranny of the priests; and perhaps,
I may add, he endeavoured, by the introduction of foreign ornaments,
to regenerate a taste for architecture and sculpture: but in this
specimen we only see the last effort of a people whose greatness was
passed away, their taste corrupted, and all the lights of knowledge
and civilisation just expiring. The elegant pyramids of Meroe differ
as widely, in taste and execution, from the immensely extensive
but ill-planned ruins of Wady el Owataib, as the best sculpture at
Thebes, during the age of Rameses II., differs from the corrupted
style under the Ptolemies and Cæsars.

I had intended to have proceeded from the ruins of El Owataib to
those of El Mecaurat, farther in the Desert; but my stock of water
was almost exhausted, in consequence of my guide and camel-driver
not having brought their own supply, according to agreement,
also on account of several of my own geerbahs proving bad, and our
consumption, owing to the extreme heat, having been twice what we
expected. Signor Bandoni seems to be apprehensive of a deficiency,
and anxious to guard against it; for yesterday evening I found him
in my tent with his mouth at a three-gallon geerbah. His draughts
were profounder than his philosophy, for by his earnestness he seemed
intent on trying whether he himself possessed that valuable faculty
which his experience in the desert had taught him the camels possess;
that of imbibing, at one draught, a sufficient store for a week. We
left the ruins at half-past twelve, and arrived at the Nile at half
past six. We saw on our road numerous traces of the lions, hyenas,
tigers (nimr), wild asses, and ostriches, and near the river,
guinea-fowls. Shortly before arriving at the Nile, we passed the
bed of a canal which seemed to be ancient. They informed me that it
extends very far into the Desert towards the ruins of Mecaurat.

_March_ 11. We left this morning at seven, and reached the ruins
of Abou Naga at nine. The two square pillars which remain of
this temple, are very curious. On each side is a representation
of what is generally called a figure of Typhon, above which is
the head of Isis or Athor. These figures are very much injured,
but the style is extremely bold and decidedly very ancient. The
people above Meroe, says Diodorus, worship Isis and Pan, and also
Hercules and Zeus. This Typhonian figure is called Pthah by many,
and considered as an immediate emanation from Jupiter. We have here
two more divinities to add to the Ethiopian list: I use this name,
for of all the antiquities existing in the valley of the Nile, these
have the most ancient appearance. The drawing will give an exact
idea of the style of the sculpture. The reader will remark that
this is no effort of a feeble and corrupt taste, no imitation of a
foreign (Egyptian) style, but the spirited work of an early period,
when the productions of art would naturally be more remarkable for
force and vigour than for exquisite or delicate finish. There are
no hieroglyphics, nor any appearance of there ever having been any,
which may be considered another proof of their great antiquity, an
edifice in which they are absent must either be of the most ancient
or most modern date: and certainly this latter description cannot
belong to the present structures. The style has evidently the stamp of
originality, and I therefore think it may be considered a fragment of
perhaps one of the most ancient temples which has ever been erected
in honour of the two great divinities, Isis and Typhon, or rather,
I should say, of the two principles of good and evil existing in the
world: for Isis, the Ceres of the Greeks, is a type of that benevolent
care of the Deity which furnishes men with the fruits of the earth;
and she is worshipped under the form of a woman, emblematical of
the maternal fondness of the great divinity. Under that view, she is
sometimes represented with her son, the infant Horus, on her knees,
as the source of the multiplication and increase of the human race.

[Illustration: TEMPLE OF ABOU NAGA.]

The figure which, in deference to the general opinion, I have called
Typhon, has been considered by many to be that of Pthah, from the
circumstance of almost similar representations having been found with
the name of that divinity in hieroglyphics; but, in the absence of
any inscription to decide the question of what this figure has been,
I must confess that I conceive it not impossible that it may be the
Hercules of the Ethiopians. Hercules, or the god of strength, would
be a type of the attribute of power in the great divinity; and that
this should be a leading representation in the primitive ages, is
not surprising, as, of course, muscular strength would then be the
endowment most highly prized. The fables of Hercules clearing the
earth of monsters were very probably partly derived from Ethiopia,
together with the worship of the divinity. The mythology of the
Ethiopians, as I may, perhaps, venture to mention more particularly
on a future occasion, appears by no means to have been a gross
polytheism. I do not mean to say that the “uncultivated mass,”
as Gibbon styles them, very little removed in point of intellect
from their fellow-labourers the oxen, could have entertained very
pure notions of religion; I only agree with those who conceive that
the more educated and enlightened classes worshipped these different
symbolical forms, not as separate and equally powerful divinities, but
as the types of the different attributes of the One great Deity. This
temple, which was about 150 feet long, seems to have been ornamented
with six pilasters, five feet square; but it was impossible to trace
the plan satisfactorily: and as I conceive the materials to have
been carried away, an excavation would be of little use. The plan
(2300 feet in circumference) shows that the town has been small,
and built of sun-burnt bricks.

[Illustration: PLAN OF THE RUINS NOW CALLED ABOU NAGA.]

I had intended to have gone from this place to the ruins of Mecaurat,
at eleven hours’ distance in the desert. The soldier who officiated
as my guide, on leaving the ruins of Wady el Owataib yesterday,
said that we could not visit the ruins of Mecaurat, as they were
situated farther in the desert; that we should most probably meet
with lions on the road; and that the danger would indubitably be
much greater than on the preceding night; that, at this season of
the year, it was folly to think of going there without a guard
or large caravan; and, to conclude, that he would not incur the
responsibility of taking me. This morning, to my surprise, he said
he was willing to accompany me, if I desired. In this uncertainty I
asked for information from the sheakhs and different peasants I met;
and the result of these enquiries was, that, Mecaurat being farther
in the mountains, lions are much more numerous there than at Wady
el Owataib; that we should probably fall in with them on the road;
that this was the most dangerous season, from their food being
scarce, and that none of the peasants lead their flocks there,
since fires do not always succeed in repelling them. A few years
ago there were few or none; but now the number was so great that I
ought not to hazard going. In fact, not one, by bribes or threats,
could be induced to join our caravan.

Notwithstanding this discouraging information, I was anxious not
to leave any of the antiquities of Ethiopia unexplored; and I felt
that I might have gone without very great risk, because we had a
proof, the night before last, of the effect of fire in frightening
lions away; and I believe, as long as there are camels, or any kind
of cattle, they would not, if unmolested, attack a human being. I
had learned, also, that there was one edifice not much ruined, and
conceived that in it a fortification might soon be made, which a lion
could not penetrate. My servants seemed evidently afraid, but said,
wherever I went they would accompany me; but my artist made so many
objections that I told him, in disgust, he might go or not, as he
thought proper. He took me at my word, and refused to accompany
me. I at first determined to go alone: but, after considering
that I should have to leave two camels and a servant with him;
that my caravan would thus be reduced in number; and as no other
camels could be procured, their owners being afraid of the lions,
I should not be able to take enough of water to enable me to stay
at the ruins a sufficient time to make all the drawings that would
be necessary; I gave up the expedition, conceiving that it was of
little importance. My funds, also, are now considerably reduced,
and I am not in a country where I can easily replenish them. The
heat is every day more intolerable. I ought, for private reasons,
to have long since been in Europe; my health has for several days
been very indifferent, from these annoyances, the excessive heat,
which for the first few days of its commencement is always most
prejudicial, and I must confess myself not a little disgusted.

I must be satisfied with having been at Meroe, on the site of the
capital of Ethiopia, which appears to me a satisfactory termination
to my more important labours in the lower part of the valley of the
Nile; and when the reader considers that I have now been nearly
fourteen months above Cairo, leading almost the life of an Arab,
without any of the comforts and charms of the civilised world,
I think he will not reproach me for not extending my travels to
Sennaar and the banks of the White River. Indeed, even had not
a private duty _obliged_ me to return to England, I should not,
I think, have gone very much farther south, as I could spend my
time much more usefully at Thebes; for, except those in the desert,
there are no antiquities beyond this point.

As to the modern capitals of Ethiopia, nothing can be more miserable
than those I have already seen. Sennaar, I am told, great, splendid,
and beautiful as the Arabs represent it, is very little larger,
and has not much more the appearance of a capital, than Shendy,
which, as I have said before, cannot be compared to many of the
small towns in Egypt. The poetical minds of the Arabs are fond of
describing in glowing terms the beauty of distant objects; as the
ancients placed the Garden of the Hesperides in the most remote
region; but the descriptions of modern travellers, and the accounts
of many sensible Turks, have satisfied me that Sennaar is not worth
half a day’s journey, and certainly not twenty-two, which would
be necessary to go thither and return.

As to the Bahr el Abiad, or White River, it would be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to penetrate to any distance on
its banks; and it is now more than ever impracticable to attempt
the discovery of its source. The Governor at Kordofan has his
_gazwah_, or hunt for slaves, on the banks of that river: there is,
therefore, scarcely a family in that part that has not lost some
relation,—fathers their sons, husbands their wives, brothers their
sisters, children their parents,—and all would rejoice to avenge
their loss on the first white man who should imprudently venture into
their territory. The source of the Nile could only, I conceive, be
discovered by an armed force; and even that method would present great
difficulties. It would require a large army to subdue the great extent
of country through which the Bahr el Abiad probably passes. Not only
the chiefs, but the whole population, instead of any of them joining
the standard of the invader, or furnishing him with provisions, would
resolutely oppose him. Each man would fight with desperation for the
preservation of his property, family, and liberty. The Shillooks,
Numrum, and other brave and warlike tribes on the White River, are
not ignorant of the wretched lot of their brethren in Cairo. Many
a fugitive slave has carried the intelligence to his tribe of the
misery and hardships they endured after they were taken prisoners;
their sufferings from the scanty allowance of water in the desert;
the numbers who perished from fatigue, heat, and thirst; their painful
journey on foot, bound in the most cruel manner; their wretched food;
their ignominious exposure for sale in the Cairo market; and, perhaps,
the cruelty of their taskmasters. These are injuries, I think,
sufficient to sharpen their sabres, and inflame their hatred and
thirst for revenge, on all Mahometans and white men. The traveller
being French or English would be of no avail. They distinguish but
two races, Pagan and Mahometan, and two colours, black and white,
their friends and enemies.

As to the source of the Bahr el Abiad, and the situation of the
Mountains of the Moon, as the Arabs of this neighbourhood have
never been there, or seen any person who has visited either the one
or the other, their suppositions are not worth more, if so much,
as the conjectures of any intelligent man in London. I think it
more candid to confess that these subjects are still involved in a
mystery, which the armies of the Pasha may possibly one day clear up;
yet he can never subdue that country with the facility with which
he made himself master of the valley of the Nile: the difference of
creed, and the deep-rooted hatred against him which prevails there,
would oblige him almost to exterminate the whole population before
he could enjoy a peaceable possession of the territory. If his
ambitious views are diverted by European interference from another
track with his immense resources, large and disciplined army,
and the great superiority derived from fire-arms and artillery,
he might penetrate even to the source of the White River, and solve
that problem which has perplexed the literary men of every age. No
private individual would be so rash as to attempt this discovery. Were
there any possibility of success, for the hope of immortality,
men could be found to encounter fearlessly the heat and fatigue,
and other ordinary dangers of the journey; but no one would be so
foolish as to expose himself to the certain death which would be
the result of any attempt made at this period.

This discovery would have been more easily accomplished before the
Pasha’s conquest; before the war of colour, if I may so describe it,
commenced: but there does not seem to have been any recent intercourse
between the inhabitants of the kingdom of Shendy and the tribes on the
banks of the White River. If any credit can be given to the accounts
of the Arabs, there are cannibals not very far up its stream. I was
told that twenty days above its junction with the Bahr el Azruk, there
is a tribe of Arabs mixed with the Pagans. I can scarcely believe
this latter statement, otherwise it would present a somewhat less
difficult method of penetrating to a certain distance. I have been
assured by several Arab merchants, and also Turks, that the water of
the river is less sweet than that of the Azruk, that the caravans
stationed on what they call the Island, between the two rivers,
universally prefer the water of the latter. The Egyptians, therefore,
are indebted to the Azruk for the singular sweetness of the waters of
the Nile. The Arab’s invariable description of the Bahr el Abiad is,
that it has waves like the Red Sea, but the current is not powerful
like that of the Blue River; that a boat would sail rapidly up,
on account of the prevailing northerly winds, but it would be more
difficult to descend. It is not improbable that the reason of the
superior rapidity of the Blue River is its greater proximity to its
source in the mountains, whilst the Bahr el Abiad may pass through
immense districts, where the surface is more level and uniform.

Of the inundation of the Nile I will speak hereafter; only remarking
at present, that during the whole of this journey I have not met
one sensible Arab, who was ignorant that the rains in Ethiopia were
followed by the rise of the river, and that, according to the wetness
of the season, the inundation was more or less beneficial. I do not
mean to say that they are acquainted with the real causes of those
rains,—the rarefying of the air by the sun in his approach towards
the tropic, and the consequent rush of vapour from the neighbouring
seas; but the circumstance of the peasants here all being aware of
the rain as the season of the inundation, excites my surprise how
the ancients, particularly as many of them visited Meroe, could be
so ill acquainted with, or, indeed, have the slightest doubt of,
the true cause. The flourishing state of the country at that period,
and the probable extent of its commerce, renders this still more
singular. If they had not been actual witnesses to the tropical rains,
(and, according to Pliny, many were,) they must have heard of them,
over and over again, from authentic sources. The most uneducated
peasant in Europe, were he to see the rain fall in torrents for
a long period, the little rivulets running into a river in his
vicinity, and yet not be aware why the latter was swollen, would be
considered to display a tenfold degree of stupidity. It can only
be accounted for by their preferring to ornament their works with
ingenious speculations rather than admit an explanation which they
could not account for.[22] We arrived at Shendy this evening at nine.

_Metammah.—March_ 12. This morning the katshef at Shendy, with
his servants and dependants, went through the Mameluke exercise
for our amusement. Six entered the list on each side. Their lances
were stalks of the palm tree, about four or five feet long. The
combatants were about 300 or 400 yards apart at the commencement,
but when the contest became more animated, not more than 100. Each
one sallied out when he liked, armed with a single lance, and, when
there was no opponent in the field, rode near the opposite party,
and generally, when at the distance of from twenty to thirty feet,
flung his lance at his adversaries within their limits, to excite them
to come forth; otherwise, when the field was full, at those who were
galloping back from pursuing their adversaries. The attacked party
trusted to the speed of the horse to save him from the lance of the
one who followed him, who, having in his turn flung his lance, was
rode after by another of the opposite party, and thus the ball was
spiritedly kept up. The requisites for these manœuvres are, perfect
management of his horse, dexterity in avoiding his adversary’s
lance, and catching it, if possible, with his hand, which enables
him to turn again upon the assailant. They are only, as I have said,
allowed to go out with one lance, and when they have thrown it, are
dependent on their agility, and the swiftness of their horses, to
save themselves from their pursuers; but the qualities most admired,
and most necessary, are strength and dexterity in throwing the lance,
and fearless indifference to blows. Each well-directed and successful
aim was hailed with a shout of admiration, and those who seemed to
fear the contest were evidently despised. The exercise is fine, but
the wounds received are sometimes not slight. There is no ostensible
respect of persons. The servant throws his lance at his master,
and the master at the servant; yet, somehow, the katshef escaped
always amid the numbers of lances which were showered around him:
a clever courtier knows how to direct his aim. Between the servants
the game sometimes became serious, and blows were exchanged with
the appearance of real enmity.

I saw this morning a number of mats and baskets made by the women,
some of which are very beautiful. They make here, also, very neat
sandals, almost exactly resembling those of the ancients. At noon I
crossed to Metammah. I found that the katshef was absent. The soldier
he had deputed to perform the duties of his office promised me eight
camels, to cross the desert of Bahiouda to Meroueh.

_Metammah.—March_ 13. A sufficient number of good camels, or
rather dromedaries, being difficult to find, I was detained the
whole of the day near this miserable little town, where there is
nothing to be seen. The country, even at this season, is not free
from malaria. Several peasants suffering from intermittent fever
applied to me for relief. Some I saw wretchedly ill, lying on their
angoureebs, without any advice, or, apparently, any person to attend
them, left to live or die according to the violence of the attack or
the strength of their constitutions. When the rains extend to this
place, which is not always the case, fevers are very prevalent:
dysentery also is very common: I have had an attack myself, and
two of my servants suffered severely from it. I used successfully a
powerful dose of opium and calomel. To my servant, who was very ill,
I gave six grains of calomel and one of opium at a time.

Once a week, in each of these small towns and villages, there is a
bazaar; a curious scene, on account of the different costumes of the
Arabs who resort to them from the country. At Metammah many of the
inhabitants have adopted the fashion of their conquerors, and shaved
their heads. The costumes of some of the women of high rank are said
to be very beautiful, but it is difficult to obtain a sight of them;
and I must confess I have not enjoyed that good fortune. My dragoman,
however, an impudent fellow, contrived, upon some pretext, to enter
the harem of the present melek of Shendy, whose wife is daughter
of the celebrated Nimr, who murdered Ismael Pasha. Her husband has
gone to the war with Hourshid Bey. The intruder found this queen,
as he called her, in a large room reposing in a most dignified
manner on a beautiful angoureeb, covered with the fine mats of the
country. She was reclining at full length; her head was supported by
a wooden pillow of about the width of a hoop, and of a semicircular
form to admit the head, and sustained by a column 4 to 6 inches high
with a broad flat base, [Symbol]. They are almost exactly similar to
those often found in the ancient tombs of the Egyptians, and which,
notwithstanding their apparent discomfort, are now very generally used
in every part of Upper Nubia. The ladies of Shendy, however, value
them highly, since, being so narrow, they do not disarrange their
hair; a serious consideration, if it be true, as I am informed, that
the _coiffure_ of the Shendyan beauties requires nine hours’ work
to be quite _comme il faut_. This lady’s hair was very curiously
dressed, beautifully plaited, and bushy at each side, projecting
behind and flat above the forehead. On this flat part were two plates
of gold, one above the other, and in the centre of her forehead was
a large gold ring. She wore two handsome gold earrings, and bracelets
of massive gold on her arms, and the same above her ankles. She wore
the cotton dress of the country, but finer than usual, and over her
neck was a beautiful shawl of Souakim with a broad silk border. He
represented her features as being extremely small and delicate; her
eyes very large and fine, and her complexion much fairer than that
of the women of the country in general. He described her as the most
beautiful woman he had seen since leaving Cairo, and doubted if,
in his life, he had observed any one superior to her. She looked,
he said, like a queen.

In a circle, squatted on the ground beneath, were about twenty
female slaves, some very beautiful, busily employed in pounding and
preparing spices for the ointment with which they perfume their
persons and soften their skins. Her nails were extremely long;
a decided indication, in this country, of high rank, as proving
that the person never condescends to employ her fingers in any
work. To promote their growth, they are held over small fires of
cedar wood. This is an ancient custom, and Cailliaud mentions having
observed, at Naga, a representation of a queen with long nails;
and it still prevails among the Chinese of the highest rank. This
wife, or queen, of the melek, possesses a large fortune, said to
amount to 50,000_l._ sterling; an enormous amount for a country
like this. She increases it daily by commerce, keeping constantly
in her employ Arab merchants, who trade in caravans on her account
to Abyssinia, Kordofan, Sennaar, and Cairo. Their chief traffic now
is in slaves. Two of her merchants were in the room when my dragoman
entered. She eyed him at first fiercely and haughtily, and asked him
whether he was one of the Christians just arrived, and how he dared
to enter there? Being a clever insinuating fellow, with the advantage
of being a Mahometan, he soon ingratiated himself into her favour,
and had some dinner ordered for him. As she was the first queen he
had ever seen, and the daughter of the celebrated Nimr, he examined
her very attentively. The reader will perhaps be dissatisfied with
a description thus given upon hearsay; but I should state that,
from numerous enquiries, I have found it perfectly applicable to the
great ladies in this country; and my dragoman, although an Arab, is
the most intelligent clever servant I have met with any where. The
account of this great lady may remind the reader of Bruce’s Sittina.

_March_ 14. We started this morning at noon; and now, thank Heaven,
my face is toward the north, and every day will bring me nearer
England. I have still a journey of nearly 1600 miles before I even
reach Alexandria, with deserts to pass and hardships to undergo.[23]
We have suffered already very severely from heat and fatigue. For
some time past the thermometer, between eleven and four, has been
96° to 100° in the shade; on one day as high as 104°, and another,
110°. The wind blows almost every day very strong from the north;
but in the interior deserts of Africa, the atmosphere soon becomes so
heated, by the scorching sun, that the wind which, in other regions,
braces and invigorates man, is felt as hot and oppressive. It is
refreshing at night, and near the river; but in the desert, for a
great part of the day, almost insupportable. Our umbrellas, with
which we sheltered ourselves from the sun, have been all broken by
the wind, and others we had constructed met to-day a similar fate;
but we protect ourselves with our sheets as well as we can. There is
no apparent ascent from the Nile into the desert. After five hours’
journey we encamped for the night. The desert is slightly covered
with sand, but not so much as to impede the camels: in other respects
it almost resembles a park, covered, to a great extent, with trees
and herbage, though the latter has rather a burnt appearance. The
trees are chiefly acacias, bearing full yellow flowers, and in their
forms sometimes resembling small oaks, others the tops of the Italian
pine trees.

_March_ 16. We have been ten hours _en route_ this day. As we
advanced into the desert, I observed not quite so many trees,
and also less herbage. After five hours’ journey—that is,
ten after leaving the Nile—we arrived at a spot called Aboulay,
where numerous wells occur. The Arabs filled their water-skins; and,
had I not been well provided from the Nile, I should have drunk of
it without hesitation, as it seemed tolerably sweet and wholesome.

On this journey I could not escape from some serious and even
painful reflections. However the traveller may be fascinated with
this kind of life,—free from the restraints and passions of the
world; living in the patriarchal style; mounted on his dromedary;
sleeping under a tent, and sometimes without one; covered with no
other canopy than the blue sky;—exquisite as may be the pleasure of
exploring unfrequented lands, treading unbeaten paths, and leading his
caravan over these terrible wildernesses; still, there are thoughts,
not to be resisted, which crowd upon the mind, and unnerve even the
strongest. This is not the land of our birth; we are strangers to
the customs, manners, language, and religion of the people: their
hospitality and civility are merely the effort of their benevolence,
and the performance of a duty. No tie of relationship, no chain of
affection, no sympathy of ideas, no bond of union, exists between
us. The dissimilarity of our colour, of the climate and aspect of
the country, as compared with ours, is not more complete than that
of our habits and feelings. All that we love, all that we care
for, is separated from us by immense tracts of desert sands; and
we have to pass rivers, seas, and several thousand miles before we
reach the land of our home. I can also assure my fair countrywomen
that it is no trifling deprivation to see and converse with none
but these swarthy savage beauties, from whose society no man of any
refinement can derive the slightest gratification. My Italian artist,
who sings remarkably well, entertains me sometimes with the favourite
airs from Rossini’s and Bellini’s operas, and he talks to me so
much of “la bella Italia,” that I long to be again there—_but
on my way to England_.

My camel-drivers, with the exception of two Ababdes, whom I met and
engaged as they had passed the Nubian desert with me, are of the
tribe of the Shageea—fine tall warlike-looking fellows, with their
hair dressed almost like the Ababdes; but the Shageea generally wear
beards and mustachios. Their complexion is decidedly darker than that
of the Ababdes, which is a dark brown; but theirs is a darker brown,
and sometimes approaches almost to a black, but still very different
from the cold colour of the negroes. The Shageea have occasionally
wider nostrils than we should think correct, and rather thick lips,
otherwise their features would resemble exactly the European. We
have seen numbers of gazelles, and several flocks of sheep, and
passed many isolated hills: the sand is firm, and not fatiguing for
the camels. Six inches below the surface is sandstone rock.

_March_ 17. We have been ten hours on the road. Had it not been
for the extreme heat, and my health being indifferent, I should have
enjoyed my journey through this desert; for, although not picturesque,
the abundance of acacias makes it extremely beautiful. We have passed
several isolated hills; and on the sand yesterday, as well as to-day,
I observed many of the round balls of iron-flint, or iron-glance,
sometimes of a red, but generally of almost a black, colour. A
distinguished mineralogist has informed me that they are common sand,
agglutinated by oxide of iron, such as may be seen on Hampstead Heath,
&c., rolled by water. They are similar to those observed during my
first two or three days’ journey in the great Nubian desert.

_March_ 18. After four hours’ ride I arrived at a range of
mountains, the crust of which consists of quartz and decomposed
granite; but the basis of most of the rocks in this quarter is
sandstone. At a distance I fancied we were approaching a passage cut
through the mountains; but on arriving it proved a deep recess in
the rock, having the appearance of being worn by a torrent, and now
forming a well, or rather cistern, almost entirely protected from
the rays of the sun by a projecting rock. During the winter, and
when the tropical rains extend so far north, the water is above five
times its present depth, which is only eight feet. It is now green,
and disagreeable to the taste; but, fortunately, my stock of Nile
water is not finished, as I must confess I should not have relished
to quench my thirst, under a burning sun, with this beverage. My
satisfaction was the greater when I observed that my camel-drivers,
when they had filled their water-skins, bathed and washed themselves
in the pool; doubtless the usual custom of the caravans. We expected
to find flocks here, and procure an additional supply of meat. My
artist being extremely unwell, and wishing for soup, I gave a
backsheesh of ten piastres to one of the camel-men, who mounted
an unloaded dromedary, and went out of the road, towards the west,
to a source of water, where he said there were Arabs of the tribe
of the Hassanyeh: he joined us after three hours, having succeeded
in purchasing a goat for five, and an excellent gazelle for two,
piastres. We have seen numerous herds, of five or six each, of the
latter, but have never been able to approach within shot of them. At
a short distance from hence, they tell me that there are antelopes
(Arabic, _buggera el Atmoor_). It is singular that, on this side of
the river, ferocious animals are rare. There are some few hyenas, but
the panthers and lions seem confined chiefly to the Island of Meroe.

This reservoir of water, called Gagdool, is out of the direct road;
we went from it due west for a short time, and then resumed our course
towards the north-west. I should have made a drawing of these rocks,
but I was really so unwell that I felt unequal to the exertion. At
noon we reposed for a short time under our tent. There are abundance
of acacias, but they afford little shade; whence the Arab proverb,
“The friendship of man is like the shade of the acacia.” At Shendy
I bought a splendid greyhound dog; perhaps of a larger species than
ours, stronger, and with more bone, but showing much breeding. I was
surprised to find the true race of greyhound dog in the centre of
Africa; but, in fact, there is a representation of it on the walls
of a tomb at Thebes, forming part of magnificent offerings received
from Ethiopia. (See Plate XLVI.) I should have been glad to have
brought him to England, but he died in consequence of the heat,
added to his fatigue in following the camel, and perhaps not having
sufficient water, although I spared him as much as I could out of my
own individual stock[24], in order that I might save him. I placed
him on the back of a camel; but he would not remain.

_March_ 19. Nine hours this day. We arrived at eleven at a well,
in a valley at the commencement of a range of granite rocks of the
usual round formation by which they are always known: quartz nodules
were scattered in the valley. The water of this well is the best we
have tasted since we left the Nile, yet not what I should like to
drink. The Arabs say that we shall arrive at a better to-morrow. The
source is called Magaga. We encamped earlier than usual this evening,
my artist being unable to go any farther. Last night he had a severe
attack of bilious fever. Calomel is the best remedy for that complaint
in this climate. I gave him a dose of six grains, and this morning
he was wonderfully better, but the fatigue and heat of the day have
brought on a relapse. He wants spirit to assist in throwing off the
disease, is afraid of dying in the desert, and thinks it impossible
he shall live to see the Nile again. He fancies that without plenty
of sustenance he cannot exist; and therefore forces his appetite,
instead of living abstemiously, as he ought. I have given him six
grains more this evening, but have found great difficulty in inducing
him to take them, although he is sensible of the benefit he derived
from the others. I am exceedingly anxious about the effect of the
medicine, from the responsibility I feel in having brought him into
the deserts. His reproaches on the subject are harassing, although
unjust; for he was engaged under the condition of making this journey.

_March_ 20. My artist was exceedingly ill the early part of last
night, but at last he fell into a profuse perspiration, after which
he dropped asleep, and awoke this morning quite relieved. He allows
a certain merit to the pills, but much more to his having vowed
to present wax candles to the Madonna on his return to Italy:
he has made other promises of the same kind for deliverance from
various dangers. An hour after starting this morning, we arrived at
a well called Haless, situated, like the one we passed yesterday,
in a valley. The water is most delicious, quite equal to that of
the Nile. We emptied all our geerbahs of the water they contained,
which, from the extreme heat, had become black and bad, and filled
them from this delicious fountain. I never enjoyed any luxury so
much as this cold, clear, fresh draught.

We encamped after nine hours’ ride. Although the scenery is
not sufficiently bold to be termed picturesque, it is impossible
to conceive a more beautiful desert; valleys and rocks with
mountains, whose forms are varied, broken, sometimes conical, but
never monotonous. The low grounds are covered with sweet-smelling
acacias. The herbage has certainly, at this season, a very burnt
appearance; but had there been a greensward, instead of these yellow
sands and this long discoloured grass, few spots would be more lovely
than the Desert of Bahiouda.

_March_ 21. We rode ten hours to-day. The plains are rather more
extensive, but still beautiful. We met, this morning, shepherd boys
with geerbahs on their arms, containing their provision of water, and
they had a few loaves of dourah bread tied in their garment. In this
way they conduct their flocks to the pasturages distant from the well,
and return when their stock of provision is consumed. I observed,
several times, this morning, traces of torrents. The mountains in this
desert are generally of grey and pink-coloured granite, often of the
description called syenite; many are of sandstone, hornblende, and
conglomerates; while others are of decomposed granite and decomposed
felspar. At eleven o’clock we passed a well of good water called
Hennek, now forty feet deep and proportionally wide. There are no
traces of its being recently excavated, nor any thing to mark it
as ancient, but it is too great an undertaking for the Arabs of the
present age to have accomplished. We are encamped near another source
of rain water, called Prasoli. There are about twenty houses or sheds
scattered around, inhabited by peasants and their flocks. We have
met two caravans of merchants from Dongolah. The manner the Shageea
salute, leaning their right arms over the breasts and shoulders
of each other, has a very dignified and noble appearance, and is
quite in harmony with that frank sincerity and honest affection,
which characterise the Arabs of the desert.

_March_ 22. We set out, as usual, at seven, and, at twelve o’clock
of the eighth day from Metammah, arrived again at the river. A short
distance from the Nile, in a wild solitary situation, we passed some
fine ruins of a large Coptic church. It is built of stone covered with
cement. There are several windows, and naves in the interior. There
are also several doors, and over them the Maltese cross. At the
top of the building are remains of an Egyptian cornice and beading,
but the plan of the interior is evidently that of a church. It was
built, probably, of the materials of a temple, of which the peasants
inform me that the traces were recently visible, but are now entirely
buried by the encroaching sands of the desert. I went to the place
where it was said to have existed, but could find no vestiges of
it. We were detained some time on the south side of the Nile, but,
after firing repeatedly, a boat came over for us.

Immediately on arriving at the town of Meroueh, I paid a visit to
the katshef who has the command of this district. I found him very
anxious to be of service to us; and his assistance was most useful
in enabling me to procure a fresh supply of bread; a thing difficult
to be had in a country where very little of any grain except dourah
is either raised or eaten. I was fortunate in obtaining as much
rice as I was in need of from the soldiers, who were very willing
to sell their rations. Our sugar and tea is consumed: the latter,
of course, is not to be procured in such a region as this. In this
village, or rather little capital of the province of Dar Shageea,
and in the country around, we could only find one loaf of sugar,
which was black, and the owner made me pay ten times its value.

We left the camels, which brought us across the desert, on the
other side of the river: we, therefore, cannot go on to Gibel el
Birkel this evening, since no other camels can be found to carry
the luggage. As the distance is more than an hour’s walk, I have
not time to go and return before dark, and am therefore obliged to
restrain my curiosity until to-morrow.

Meroueh is an ill-built miserable place. In the fortress where the
katshef resides, and which formerly belonged to Melek Shoush, is a
pedestal of basalt, on which are two ovals, with names and titles
on them, which I could not copy, on account of the accumulation of
filth that covered them. I had it washed, and traced sufficient of
the hieroglyphics to perceive that the name is the same as that of
an Ethiopian king I afterwards found on the great temple at Gibel el
Birkel. In the court of the same castle is a fragment of a statue of
the same material, the sculpture of which is good. The coincidence
between the modern name of Meroueh and the ancient capital Meroe
is curious. Was this the commencement of the kingdom of which Meroe
was the metropolis?

MOUNTAIN. — TEMPLE BUILT BY THE TIRHAKA OF THE BIBLE. — VARIOUS

AND POINTED ARCH INVENTED IN ETHIOPIA.


Gibel el Birkel is situated an hour’s walk, or three miles and a
half, to the east of the small town of Meroueh, and the mountain is
5150 feet distant from the Nile. It is an insulated hill, situated in
a large plain; and below it, on the south side, are the ruins, also
the cultivated land and the river. The other sides of the mountain
are bordered by the desert, which has, no doubt, made encroachments
on what was once cultivated land. The height of the eminence is about
350 feet. The exterior is rough, part of it having been worked to
furnish materials for the temples, and more recently large masses
have fallen, and almost entirely buried two temples which were
situated beneath. The hill is of sandstone, of a soft description,
which accounts for the dilapidated state of all the remains; for
not only would the influence of time and the seasons be greater,
but the difficulty would, of course, be less in destroying them. In
some parts, the mountain is nearly perpendicular: the form is very
picturesque, and highly imposing, particularly at a distance.

My general view (Plate XVIII.), drawn by myself with the camera
lucida, will give a correct idea of the site of the ancient city;
but it differs so much from the view Cailliaud has published, that
it will scarcely be recognised as the same place; and, indeed,
nearly all our plans and drawings are equally dissimilar. I can
only state, that neither time nor pains were spared, either by my
artist or myself, to render ours as accurate as possible. The total
circumference of the mountain (see Plate XVII.) is about 5000 feet,
which may be divided thus:—

                                                                   Feet.

  From the temple of Isis or Typhonium to the temple
  destroyed by the mountain                                          400

  From the latter to the Grand Temple                                100

  To the point where the mountain takes a direction
  almost to the north, passing the traces of the town,
  which extends for 500 feet                                         600

  Direction towards the north                                        700

  Ditto towards the north-west                                      1100

  Ditto towards the south-west                                       100

  Ditto nearly south                                                2000
                                                                    ----

                                                                    ----

GIBEL EL BIRKEL.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The form of the eminence is not very unlike that of the Acropolis
of Athens, but there certainly never was any fortification on this
rock. Some broken pottery and bricks, on the eastern side, indicate
the site of the town. On the opposite, or western side of the
mountain, but more in the desert, are two groups of pyramids. One
consists of nine, the other, still farther in the desert, of
eight. They are surrounded by sand, on the surface of which great
quantities of quartz pebbles are disseminated.

Besides the two temples, mentioned as having been destroyed by the
falling of a part of the mountain, there are the remains of eight
other edifices, principally temples. The one I first arrived at,
situated at the south-west corner of the mountain, is perhaps the
most interesting of all. (See Plate XIX.)

I admired exceedingly the beautiful and picturesque form of Gibel el
Birkel; but the ruins in the distance, scattered beneath the southern
side of the mountain, excited to the greatest degree my curiosity. I
felt, indeed, that I was undoubtedly approaching the site of the
capital of a formerly rich and flourishing region. The situation
at once announces it, and the magnificent remains bear testimony to
its importance, and, I may truly add, to the taste, knowledge, and
refinement of the ancient inhabitants of this now deserted city. Plate
XX. is a view of the ruins which first engaged my attention. It shows
the remaining fragment of the propylon, and the manner in which
the columns forming the first court were ornamented. The head of
Isis adorns the eastern and western sides of the columns, fronting
the avenue and enclosure, where they would be seen conspicuously,
but the other two sides have merely the lotus flower; an economy of
sculpture never seen in Egyptian edifices. This drawing also shows
the entrance into the chambers which were excavated out of the
rock. Plate XIX. is the best point of view that I could fix upon,
and indeed a better could not be desired, as it shows seven columns,
ornamented with the capitals of the head of Athor, which are all that
remain; and it also comprises the only Typhonian pillar that is now
entire in the portico. My drawings will, I trust, give the reader
a full idea of the imposing appearance of these ruins. I will now
enter into a more detailed architectural description of this temple,
of which we have given the plan and section, Plates XXI. and XXII.

The length of this temple is 115 feet 6 inches, the breadth (in the
interior) 50 feet 2 inches. The pylon is almost entirely destroyed,
but sufficient is left to prove that its depth was 11 feet 3 inches,
and total width 62 feet 6 inches: there are no remains of the
entrance into this portico, but I have restored it according to
the usual form. This pylon leads into a portico 59 feet long and
50 feet 2 inches wide. I know not why Cailliaud and others have
made two rooms of this portico, and a difference in the diameter of
the columns. My artist had sufficient time to make the plan, which,
with the section, were drawn out, as I give them, on the spot. This
was our habitation, and in my examination of the ruins I did not
see any authority to induce me to suppose that there had been two
apartments. All the columns were so easily traced, that the plan,
with the exception of the propylon, may be considered entire.

GENERAL VIEW OF GIBEL EL BIRKEL.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

This portico consists of two rows of seven columns each, and two rows
of the same number of square pillars. The latter form the centre
avenue, while the columns are arranged between the pillars and
exterior wall. The centre rows, forming the avenue into the temple,
are ornamented on the side fronting the avenue with figures of the
deformed Pthah, or what is generally called Typhon, above which
is a capital, decorated with representations of the lotus flower,
supporting ovals; between the latter are branches of palm trees. One
of these pillars remains entire, and the traces of the others
are visible. Behind them are circular columns, with the capitals
of the head of Athor, above which is the common representation of
the monolithic temple with the serpent and globe. On the reverse is
the same. The sides are decorated (as I have said in my description
of Plate XX.) with the lotus flower, instead of the head of Athor,
above which are similar monolithic temples. The sculpture of these
heads of Isis is tolerable (see Plate XIX.), but not so bold as on
the pillars at Naga. The diameter of the columns is 3 feet 6 inches;
their total height 17 feet 6 inches, including the bases. The shaft
of the column, consisting of five pieces, measures 9 feet. The head
of Athor 3 feet 4 inches, the monolithic temple 4 feet 6 inches. The
diameter of the Typhonian pillars is 4 feet 3 inches. The columns
with the Athor-headed capital rest on circular bases, 4 feet in
diameter, and 8 inches high; the figures of Typhon are 12 feet 4
inches high; the total height of the pillar 17 feet. The height of
the legs of this figure is 4 feet 6 inches; the length of the body
from the shoulder to its legs 6 feet; the head is 3 feet 8 inches
long; making in all 14 feet 2 inches. The difference from the total
height of the statue, which is only 12 feet 4 inches, is accounted
for by the circumstance of the head of the monster reaching over
its breast, the shoulders being nearly on a level with its ears,
while its belly hangs down between its legs.

The side walls of the temple seem never to have been above 5 feet
6 inches high, as may be observed in the section. Besides the wall
not being broken, the circumstance of the capitals of the columns
being ornamented, on the sides fronting the wall, with the heads
of Isis, whilst on the north and south sides the architect did
not take the trouble thus to decorate them, proves that, from the
lowness of the wall, such an ornament was there quite requisite. The
circumstance, also, of the sides of the column towards the centre
avenue being in a great measure concealed by the Typhonian figures,
would suggest the idea of this variation from the general plan, and
induce them to erect only a low wall, in order that the columns with
the Athor-headed capital might be visible. This portico leads into a
room excavated out of the rock, ornamented with two figures of Typhon:
the height of these, including a kind of basket above their heads,
and plinths (see section), is 12 feet 4 inches. The sides of this
room are ornamented with sculpture, representing the king Tirhaka,
and his beautiful and royal bride Amentikatah, making offerings and
libations to the god Amun Ra, Lord of the Rulers, with the head-dress
of a large globe and two feathers; behind whom is Maut, with a plain
helmet on her head. On the opposite side the king, with the titles,
God beneficent, Lord of the World, Beneficent King, Son of Phre
(Pharaoh), is offering vases to the divinity Io, whose head-dress
consists of four plain feathers. She has the jackal-headed staff in
one hand, and in the other the _crux ansatus_. Behind this divinity
is a representation of Koht, with the head of a lioness, sustaining
a globe. I have copied the hieroglyphics, as also the dedicatory
inscription around the room.

On the columns of the portico scarcely any hieroglyphics are legible;
those few that are so I have copied. The room last described leads
into the sanctuary, also excavated out of the rock. It is 22 feet
10 inches long, by 12 feet 8 inches broad, and is ornamented with
sculpture, representing the king making offerings to the divinities,
with the attributes of Amun Ra, Neith, Honsoo, Horus, Kneph, and
Thoth. On the west side of the sanctuary is another excavated room,
22 feet 10 inches long, and 7 feet 6 inches wide. This is also
ornamented with sculpture, much broken, representing the king making
offerings to Kneph, Thoth, and Horus.

TEMPLE OF TIRHAKA, GIBEL EL BIRKEL.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

On the east side of the sanctuary are two rooms, the first 17 feet
long by 7 feet 7 inches wide. The sculpture represents the king, with
the attributes and titles of Thoth, addressing numerous divinities
seated, all with the same figure of a mummy and a jackal-headed staff
in their hands. Before the first is a pedestal with a lotus flower
upon it. The second room, leading out of the last I have described,
is unfinished, and is only 5 feet long and 7 feet wide. The plan
will show that the rooms on each side the sanctuary have no direct
communication with the latter, but lead out of the first excavated
chamber.

This is not only the most curious of all the temples of Gibel el
Birkel, four of the chambers being excavated out of the rock; but
it is also in every respect the most picturesque and interesting,
particularly from being in the best preservation. Though an
excavation, it is apparently not very ancient.[25] I found no other
name upon it than that of Tirhaka, which is found on the columns
of the portico, and also in the interior. This is the Pharaoh, as
will be seen by the Historical Appendix, who assisted Hezekiah in
his war against Sennacherib. In clearing out the stones and rubbish
from the sanctuary, to make it a more comfortable residence, I made
the curious discovery of a gutter, 4 inches deep and 9 inches broad,
which crosses the ancient stone floor. It was probably to receive
the blood of the sacrifices.

The sculpture of this temple has not the striking characteristics
of the true Ethiopian style; it more resembles the Egyptian, and
is good, though by no means the best. It is not improbable that
this Ethiopian dynasty, being possessed also of Egypt, introduced
into their own country a taste for the improved style of Egyptian
sculpture. Ages must have elapsed before the Ethiopian manner could
have changed to one so entirely different as this is.

The next ruin I arrived at is marked D in the plan, and is nearly
300 feet distant from the Typhonium. This space of 300 feet between
the two temples is covered with ruined fragments, doubtless part
of the city. The temple D is not remarkable for architectural
beauty. It is much injured, and the sculpture and hieroglyphics
which ornamented the interior are quite defaced; scarcely a vestige
of the latter remaining to tell that they existed. The plan of the
temple may be distinctly traced. It consisted only of two rooms:
the first ornamented with four columns; the second is the sanctuary,
in which is a plain stone for an altar: the length of the edifice
is 85 feet, and the width 65. I saw no reason to suppose that it
ever had an additional portico in front. The defaced state of the
hieroglyphics and sculpture is no proof, in this instance, of its
great antiquity, but may be accounted for by the peculiar softness
of the stone. Close or adjoining to this temple, on the east side,
are some walls and columns of other edifices (E in the plan); but,
from what remains, little, I think, would be gained by an excavation,
as there are no hieroglyphics.

At 125 feet to the north, that is, behind the last-described ruins,
are the remains of the propylon of a small temple. (See the foreground
of Plate XXIII., and to the right, in the distance, of Plate XXV.) Its
south side is ornamented with sculpture, representing the king
sacrificing prisoners to Amun; a subject so often repeated on the
propylons of Egypt. The other side of the propylon is also ornamented
with sculpture. (See Plate XXIII.) It represents a sphinx on a
pedestal, under which is a figure with feathers, and also a pedestal
with some vases. I copied the hieroglyphics which were legible. They
contain the name and titles of a king called Amun Sekon. The upper
part of the oval, on the south side of the propylon, is destroyed;
but on the north, where it is perfect, it seems to be _Strength of
Amun Sekon_. The similarity of the name Sekon and Sethus, the first
of the nineteenth dynasty, is curious. The hieroglyphics above the
sphinx seem to allude to the offering of an obelisk to the king, and
the inscription above the vases states their number to be forty. The
width of this temple is 60 feet. The _sekos_ has been destroyed by
the falling of part of the mountain; and another temple, C, close
adjoining, has suffered in a similar manner. Of the latter still
slighter traces remain: a few fragments of columns and part of a
wall alone indicate that it ever existed.

TEMPLE BUILT BY TIRHAKA, GIBEL EL BIRKEL.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

_Great Temple at Gibel el Birkel._—The temple I next arrived at, 75
feet from the latter, marked F in the plan, had attracted my attention
on first arriving at the mountain. It is now little more than an
immense confused pile of ruins. One column only remains entire;
having the capital of the form of the lotus-bud; denoting its epoch,
not only by its style, but by the name still legible on the slab
of the capital. Of the vast number of columns which ornamented the
porticoes, vestibules, and apartments of this enormous edifice, one
only remains; a sad relic of departed splendour: and this, defaced,
tottering, and almost bent with age, cannot long answer the purpose
of transmitting to posterity the name of its royal founder. It
seems almost by a miracle to have survived the ruin which surrounds
it: and we may congratulate ourselves on this circumstance; for,
if it had fallen a generation earlier, the fragments would have
been swallowed up by the desert or carried away by the Arabs; and,
consequently, the style of the architecture, and the name of the
king who, perhaps, built this splendid edifice, would have remained
wrapped in impenetrable mystery.

Few temples in Egypt are more extensive or finer than this must
once have been. Sufficient still remains to show its extent
and magnificence: traces of columns, fragments of battle-scenes,
and sacred processions, display its _architectural_ beauty and the
interesting historical events which once adorned its walls. The cruel
hand of time, some convulsion of nature, or, what is most probable,
the barbarous hand of man, have destroyed them, and thus torn many
interesting pages from the history of the world.

A general view of these ruins may be seen in the background of Plate
XXIII., which gives a correct idea of the confused mass that now
remains; and my view (Plate XXV.), the most picturesque of any that
I have of Gibel el Birkel, represents in the foreground the solitary
column before mentioned. The separate plan (Plate XXIV.) of this
temple I drew myself, and spared no pains to make it as correct as
possible, excavating for that purpose: and had I been less acquainted
with Egyptian edifices, I could not have succeeded so well. The
exact form of the first propylon of this temple is not discernible,
being quite destroyed, great part of the stones carried away, and the
rest covered almost entirely with the sand which drifts continually
from the desert. The dimensions given to the propylon in the plan,
I obtained by some little excavation, and by observations of the
ground. I do not pretend to say they are quite correct; but, from the
dilapidated state of this part of the temple, more exact measurements
cannot, I think, now be obtained. To understand fully the following
detailed description of this edifice, the reader must refer to my
plan. The total length of the temple is nearly 500 feet. The first
court is 150 feet long, and 135 wide, and was surrounded by a row
of columns, 5 feet 9 inches in diameter, resting on bases 7 feet 6
inches in diameter. Nine only of these columns are now visible. These,
however, are sufficient to afford a correct idea of what the court
has been. I obtained the intercolumniation by excavation, and have
thus ascertained that this court must have been ornamented with 26
columns, and not more, as it has been represented. There were nine
on each side, including the angles, and four at each end.

The propylon of the second court is also much injured, but not to
the same extent as the first. On the south-west side, which is less
injured than the other, I found the remains of a staircase leading
to the top of the edifice. The depth of this propylon, which is 28
feet, I was able to ascertain with more precision than the other. The
second court is 125 feet long and 102 wide. It was curiously laid
out, in a manner which first made me conceive it to have originally
formed two rooms: the first containing four rows of six columns each,
two on each side; and the second room, six rows of columns of three
each: but, on further examination, I found that there was no mark
on the side walls of its having been thus divided. There is a thin
wall, which connects together the seventh and eighth columns of the
centre avenue, that is, the last of the columns that would have
been in the first room, and the first of the second. This proves
that this could never have formed more than one court; for, had it
been divided into separate rooms, these columns could not have been
connected. I conceive it most probable that, as the architectural
part of a temple was generally constructed before the ornamental,
the columns may have been erected with the intention that it should
have been divided into two rooms; but that afterwards, as the making
the whole one apartment formed no very great architectural defect,
though it certainly was one, this arrangement was adopted, probably
in order to afford a more continued space for the procession which
adorned the walls. Otherwise, rooms leading into the sanctuaries,
ornamented with six rows of columns, of three each, agree exactly
with the general description of an Egyptian temple.

With some little excavation, I found the traces of all the columns
marked in the plan on the western side, and two on the other, with
a similar connecting wall above mentioned: the width of the centre
avenue was 17 feet. The diameter of the columns is 5 feet 5 inches;
and they rest on circular bases. A reference to the plan will show
that the nine columns on each side, forming the centre avenue, are in
an exact line. The six columns of the second row, on entering, are
in a line with the intercolumniation of the second and third rows,
of what I, at first, erroneously conceived to be a separate portico.

On the west side of the second propylon are the fragments of a
battle-scene, now almost unintelligible. Shattered pieces of a
warhorse, of a king drawing his bow, and of slain combatants, denote
that the historical representation of some celebrated conflict has
been sculptured there. The side walls of this court seem to have
been covered with splendid processions, perhaps equal to that in
the beautiful portico at Medenet Abou; but nothing remains, except,
in one place, a few heads; in another, the hawk and jackal standards,
and several fragments of feet and limbs; and here and there, one or
two hieroglyphics occur. I regret exceedingly that these sculptures
are so completely destroyed, as, doubtless, they would have made
an interesting addition to the pages of history. The battle, with
its horrors—the resistance, flight, and slaughter—the fiery
steed, trampling on the dying—the portraits and the names of the
vanquished people—the warrior’s triumph and gratitude to the
gods, and the processions in commemoration of his victory—were,
no doubt, sculptured on these walls. This once beautiful temple,
and the historical records with which it was adorned, are now almost
entirely destroyed. Sufficient only is remaining to prove the beauty
of the style, and make us sensible of the loss we have experienced
in its destruction. The nature of the event these sculptures told,
may be imagined; but as matter of history it is lost for ever.

TEMPLE partly excavated out of the Rock GIBEL EL BIRKEL.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The next room is 51 feet long and 56 feet wide, and was ornamented
with a row of five columns on each side, the diameter of which is
4 feet 2 inches, and they rest on circular bases: the latter are
on pedestals. On each side of this room was a gallery, in one of
which there now remain two columns. It seems to me probable, from
the space between the last-described room and the sanctuary (see
Plan), that a gallery crossed the temple at the end of the third
room, out of which there were probably three outlets. Those at the
sides would lead into small chapels, and the centre one into the
sanctuary. As I have no authority, however, for this supposition,
I have not marked it in my plan; but the reader who has studied the
construction of Egyptian edifices will perceive its probability.

The sanctuary is, fortunately, in better preservation: its width
is about 16 feet, the length uncertain. The wall which enclosed it
could only have been of a certain height, perhaps a few feet, as,
immediately behind it, on each side, are four columns, the diameter of
which is 4 feet. Near the extremity of the sanctuary is a beautiful
granite altar, which I found almost entirely covered with rubbish,
and got it cleared. The device is very elegant, representing four
kings, or, rather, four representations of the same king, Tirhaka,
supporting the Egyptian entablature; and the base of the altar is
also tastefully ornamented. Between the figures are four ovals: two
containing the phonetic name of Tirhaka, accompanied with the titles
of Son of Phre, or Pharaoh, the Sun, always living. The other two
ovals contain the prænomen of the king Sun, very beneficent; above
which is the title King, and below it the hieroglyphics signifying
eternal life, or always living. There is a line of hieroglyphics round
the figures, containing a dedication of the buildings to his father
Amun Ra, &c. On the east side is a subject, not uncommon in Egypt,
of the two divinities of the Nile, supporting with cords a pedestal,
over which is the name of the king. I copied the hieroglyphics of
this tablet. On the west side of the altar is a subject exactly
similar to the east, but very much defaced and broken.[26] Behind
the sanctuary is a room or inner sanctuary, 37 feet long by 21 feet
6 inches wide. A door leads out of it, on the western side, into two
small rooms. To the west of the altar, before described, is a much
larger one of basalt, 8 feet 6 inches square. There are no figures
on this altar, but some hieroglyphics, all of which I have copied:
they contain the name and titles of King Pepi, or, as Rossellini,
perhaps more correctly, calls him, Pionchei. The name of this king
I found also on the walls; but, on the capital of the column which
is still remaining there is an oval almost resembling the prænomen
of Amunneith, or, according to Mr. Wilkinson, Amun m gori III. If
it be the same, I must candidly state that this is very probably an
Egyptian, and not an Ethiopian, edifice; for the name on the columns
is generally that of the builder of the temple. There are other rooms
(as will be seen by my plan), which I have not attempted to describe,
being almost quite unintelligible.

The appearance of this temple, at a distance, is very picturesque;
but there is little in the detail to interest the traveller; its
architectural ornaments and sculpture being entirely destroyed,
except the one column already mentioned, and it, too, is considerably
injured, and off the perpendicular. To the architect, this temple
is interesting, as its plan can almost be fully traced. The mere
painter, seeking only the picturesque, would find few advantageous
points of view. But to me these ruins were deeply interesting, since,
accustomed as I am to Egyptian edifices, I found sufficient, even in
the little that remains, to understand perfectly what it has been. I
easily restored, in my conception, the lofty propylons, the splendid
courts, surrounded with the most chaste forms of Egyptian columns;
the porticoes, sanctuaries, statues, and avenues of sphinxes;—every
part enriched by the art of the painter and sculptor;—the walls and
propylons covered with the representations of mythological mysteries,
military exploits, and animated battle-scenes, which form the _chefs
d’œuvre_ of Egyptian art. I could trace, also, the portraits of the
heroes, hieroglyphical tablets, containing the history of the scenes,
and displaying the king’s piety and munificence in his offerings to
the gods. Thus, I restored the temple in my imagination; and, indeed,
there was good authority for all that I have enumerated. Were I to
refer to a period still more remote, and, filling up the vague, and
not sufficiently explicit authority of the historians, describe the
bronze, gold, silver, ivory, ebony, and precious stones, with which
it was, perhaps, adorned; the Oriental magnificence which was most
probably displayed; the mysterious ceremonies of the most mysterious
of religions; the sacrifices and burnt-offerings; the deceiving
oracles, the crafty priesthood, and the ignorant multitude gazing,
with superstitious awe, at their imposing functions,—I might then
be accused of rambling into the regions of fancy; for, unfortunately,
there are no sufficient records yet to enter into this subject: but
if the study of hieroglyphics is still continued, the veil of Isis
may, perhaps, be raised. The Arabs have carried away a great part
of the materials of this temple; and, in a short time, the little
that is remaining of this, the _Selinunte_ of Ethiopian edifices,
will be entirely buried by the sand which is daily drifted in upon
it from the desert.

GIBEL EL BIRKEL.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

_Other Ruins at Gibel el Birkel._—Twenty yards to the west of
the Typhonium, marked in the plan, are the remains of another small
temple, excavated in the rock. The first court was ornamented with
columns, and on the walls I could distinguish traces of sculpture,
but now too much defaced to be legible. Besides the temples already
mentioned, situated under the mountain, there are the traces of
another, 200 feet from the great propylon of the large temple;
that is, about 700 feet from the mountain, towards the river. A
fragment of a wall, 6 feet by 3 feet, is all that now remains:
300 feet beyond the latter is a single column, with a lotus-flower
capital. From this column to the river are 4100 feet. The mountain
is, therefore, 5100 feet distant from the Nile.

To the north of the great temple are the ruins of buildings, chiefly
of brick, which seem to have formed part of the city, but they are of
no very great extent. Here are scattered numerous pieces of pottery,
and fragments of the same description of bread stamps which are found
at Thebes, but these are without hieroglyphic inscriptions. To the
east of the great temple, in the plain, are columns and traces of
other temples, but now almost entirely buried by the sand.

I have described all the temples now existing at Gibel el Birkel,
and mentioned the remains and traces of nine, and will now treat
of the monumental decorations of its interesting Necropolis. The
magnificence, power, and piety of the monarchs of Ethiopia are
displayed in the public works erected in honour of the gods. In
this beautiful cemetery, we have monuments either of the gratitude
and attachment of their subjects, or, more probably, of their own
ostentation. The kings of Egypt are supposed, for many reasons,
which I will mention at another opportunity, to have had their tombs
constructed long before their decease; and this instructive memorial
of the transient nature of their earthly greatness was worthy of
the wisdom and philosophy of so great a nation. The Ethiopians
probably had the same custom; and considering, as Diodorus says of
the Egyptians, their palaces only as inns where they tarried for a
day, they took care to have a more suitable habitation provided for
that state, in which they believed that they were to rest for ages.

GREAT TEMPLE, GIBEL EL BIRKEL.

_London. Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The pyramids are on the western side of the mountain. The first
group, of two, is 700 feet north-west of the Typhonium, the temple
I described as excavated in the rock. (See the General Plan and
vignette.[27]) The first, A, is 30 feet square; 40 feet to the
west of this, is the other, B, which is only 23 feet square. The
pyramid C, in the plan, is 235 feet distant from the latter, and
measures 30 feet by 26: twenty feet farther to the west is pyramid
D, which is 27 feet square. The one marked E, in the plan above,
adjoining the latter, is 36 feet square; and F, partly behind this,
is of the same size. Sixteen feet to the north of F, and north-west
of the pyramids C, D, E, is the largest one at Gibel el Birkel,
which is 88 feet square: the angle of this is more obtuse than that
of any of the other pyramids at Gibel el Birkel. The ruined state of
this large pyramid, and also of the others already described, will
be seen in the distance in Plate XXVII. One hundred and forty-five
feet to the north of this large pyramid is a small one, H, which is
only 25 feet square. The angle of this is much more acute, the height
being considerably more than the diameter at the base. It is scarcely
at all injured: the apex of the pyramids at this place, like those
in the Isle of Meroe, was never pointed. A flat space was always
left at the top for a statue, perhaps, or some other ornament. One
hundred and twenty-four feet to the west of the latter is another,
I, 23 feet square. This is very much ruined, particularly on one
side, but there are the remains of a portico before the south-east
side. The other eight pyramids, of which I have given the dimensions,
were without this ornament: at all events, there are no traces now
remaining, that induced me to suppose that any of them had porches
in front. The present state of the pyramids above described may be
observed in the distance of Plate XXVII.[28]

[Illustration: PLAN OF THE PYRAMIDS OF GIBEL EL BIRKEL.]

About 600 feet to the north-west is a fine group of eight other
pyramids, situated on an eminence, which adds greatly to their effect,
and gives them, at a distance, a still more imposing appearance. They
extend for 550 feet from east to west; five of them have porticoes,
or porches, the direction of which is about south-east, but rarely
exactly the same. (See Plan.) Plate XXVI. is a general view of
these pyramids, and the vignette represents one in detail. These
being accurate camera-lucida drawings, and every stone correct,
the reader will be able to judge of the neat construction of some
of these edifices, the regularity in the size of the stones (see
Plate XXVI.), and the manner in which they are joined together,
without cement. Plate XXVII. is a view of a group of these pyramids,
which also shows their construction; and in the distance is seen
the mountain and the other group of pyramids.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The height of these monuments varies from 35 to 60 feet. They
consist, according to their height, of from 30 to 60 steps each,
receding about 6 inches. They, therefore, may be ascended, but
with difficulty. They have smooth borders at the angles, like
some of the pyramids at Meroe. The first, marked K in the plan,
p. 149., 600 feet distant from the mountain, is about 65 feet
square. It seems to have had no portico, but it is quite in ruins;
it stood upon a stone basement. Thirty-six feet to the west of the
latter is the pyramid L. This is 33 feet square, a mass of ruins,
and no traces of the portico to be seen. This pyramid is the first
to the right in Plate XXVI.; and although rather indistinct, from
being placed in the distance, its dilapidated state may still be
observed. Ninety-five feet to the west of this is M, which is 38 feet
square. This has a portico before it: the summit of it is visible in
Plate XXVI. On the hard cement with which the interior of this portico
is covered, I observed some remains of painting, rather indifferently
executed. Fifteen feet to the south, and in the view almost covering
the last, is pyramid N. This is 44 feet square and 51 feet high,
and has a portico before it. Unfortunately, very few figures were
distinguishable; but sufficient to prove the identity of the style,
which is decidedly Ethiopian. As a further confirmation of this fact,
there is an inscription in Ethiopic characters. The masonry of this
pyramid is very well executed. This pyramid is the first that may
be remarked as entire in Plate XXVI.

[Illustration: PYRAMIDS OF GIBEL EL BIRKEL.]

There are porticoes, as I have said, before five of this group
of eight pyramids, almost similar to those before the pyramids
of Meroe. Some of these are ornamented with sculpture; but,
unfortunately, destitute of hieroglyphics, which never appear to
have been inserted upon them. I copied out of the pyramid N, the
most beautiful specimen of sculpture that now remains. (See Plate
XXIX.) The style may easily be perceived to be Ethiopian, from the
roundness of the arms, and the proportions being generally more
bulky than those of the Egyptians. This style differs so widely from
that remaining in the temple built by Tirhaka, that many ages must
certainly have elapsed before such an important change could have
taken place. The subject which I have copied is not particularly
interesting, being merely a presentation of offerings, but there is
a variety and elegance in the groups, seldom surpassed in Egyptian
productions. The offerings consist chiefly of branches of palm
trees, goats, cattle, &c., and libations. In the highest row,
Osiris is represented seated on his throne, as judge of Amenti,
and the divinities Anubis and Horus, are also in the same line. The
divinity with the globe and horns, in the second row, is probably
Isis; and the last in the second row is a figure of Typhon.

A personage larger than the others is holding incense on the
same elegant description of tray, having the form of a hand and
arm, which we see in Egypt. He is presenting it to the king, or
occupant of the tomb, who is represented seated under a canopy, on a
lion-shaped chair or throne, which differs, in a very slight degree,
from that we so often see in the sculptures of Egypt. The dress of
the king is different from the Egyptian. His necklace is curious:
he has in one hand a large and strong but beautifully-formed bow,
and in the other an arrow and a branch of the palm tree[29]: the
goddess of truth, with outstretched wings, is immediately behind his
throne. The traces of colour which still remain on this sculpture
I marked on my original drawing.

PYRAMIDS OF GIBEL EL BIRKEL.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

On the other side of the portico, opposite to this sculpture, is
another subject, representing about 100 figures, rather curiously
grouped; also some large figures exactly similar to those above
described.

In the other porticoes no sculpture is perceptible, except some
fragments similar to the large figures in this plate.

At the end of some of the porticoes appear traces of the funeral
boats, similar to the one I described at Meroe. Notwithstanding some
differences, they appear to have the same signification as those over
the tombs of the kings. This circumstance, and the representation
of the goddess of truth, Osiris, the president of Amenti, and the
assistant divinities, Anubis, Thoth, and Horus, are proofs that
these were indubitably tombs.

These pyramids seem to have been the object of some learned curiosity
or avarice. Deceived by the false doors beneath the boats of the sun
at the end of the porticoes, persons have endeavoured, by blasting
the stones, to discover some inner chambers, and set at rest for ever
the question how, and for what purpose, they were constructed. The
rude force of barbarians, perhaps of Arabs, animated, probably,
by the hope of discovering treasure beneath, seems to have been
exercised in utterly destroying others.

Judging from the pyramids which are almost entirely ruined, and
from those that have been partly broken down, I do not conceive that
there is any chamber in the interior, but think it more probable that
the body was deposited in a small well, above which the pyramid was
afterwards erected. Yet Diodorus says that the Ethiopians differed
from other nations in the honours which they rendered to their
dead. “Some,” says he, “throw the bodies into the river,
believing that to be the most honourable sepulture which they
can give. Others keep them in their houses, shut up in niches of
alabaster, thinking it advantageous for a child to have ever before
his eyes the image of his father; and those who wished to preserve
the memory of their predecessors enclosed their bodies in a coffin of
baked earth, and interred them in the neighbourhood of the temples.”
The reader will have perceived, from these passages of Diodorus,
that it is not impossible that these porticoes may have been used to
contain the coffins; thus enabling the friends or children to visit
them, at the same time protecting them, to a certain degree, from the
hand of violence and the inclemency of the seasons. The mummies in
the Roman tombs in the Necropolis, in the Oasis Magna, were in wells;
and the Egyptians usually, but not invariably, interred their dead in
those receptacles. Many of the pyramids have no porticoes; therefore,
in those instances, the body must be underneath, probably in a well;
but the construction of these porticoes may have had its origin in
the piety and affection of individuals wishing to have the bodies of
their relations preserved in an accessible place, where, at certain
seasons, they could visit their remains, recall past scenes, indulge
their grief in bewailing their loss, and have ever before their eyes
a memorial of the brief sojourn of man in this valley of tears.

The pyramid marked O in the plan is thirty feet distant to the west
of N. This is 53 feet square, and the height 58 feet. This pyramid
is the second in Plate XXVI., and the B of Plate XXVIII. It will be
observed, in the view, that the upper part is very dilapidated; the
portico is very much injured; and, in consequence of the broken state
of the ground, it does not appear in my view. The sculpture which
it contains is of little importance. A figure offering incense to
the king, with the head-dress of a globe, long feathers, and short
horns. There is also a representation of the funeral boat.

PYRAMIDS AT GIBEL EL BIRKEL.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The next (P, in the plan) is 35 feet square. This is the third,
from the left, in Plate XII., and is one of the most perfect. The
height is 48 feet, and the interior width of the portico is 6 feet 6
inches. This portico is arched. There seems to have been some ornament
(perhaps an inscription) attached to many of the façades of the
pyramids; for near the summits are circular holes, in which, probably,
rivets were inserted. Mr. Waddington found a piece of granite in
one. Near the summit of this there are three of these holes.

Q is 36 feet square. There are no traces of its ever having had any
portico. This is the second, from the left, in Plate XXVI. The summit
is very much injured.

Pyramid R is the first to the left. In the vignette, page 148.,
and Plates XXVI. and XXVII., it will be observed that it is
almost perfect, but that the roof of the portico has partly fallen
in. This pyramid is also represented as restored in Plate XXVIII. An
examination of this plate will afford to the reader a good idea of
the beauty of the architectural forms of these pyramids. A, which
corresponds with R in the plan, is 41 feet in diameter, and the
height is 46 feet. The angles of these pyramids being so much more
acute than those of Geezah, adds greatly to the elegance of their
architectural form. The small ornament at the angles is pretty, and
enhances very much the effect. The façade of the portico is also
pretty, but, as will be seen by the plates, has quite a different
form from the façades of the porticoes of the pyramids of Meroe. At
the latter place the doorway is between two towers, which, although
on a small scale, are almost similar in design to those of the great
propylons of Egypt. These, as will be seen by the plate, have more
the appearance of small temples. The façade is narrower at the top
than at the bottom, the total width of the latter being 20 feet, and
at the top 17 feet 6 inches. The square band and the cornice give it
more the appearance of a small temple. The architrave over the door is
ornamented with the globe and serpents. This pyramid is also arched.

In describing the pyramids of Meroe, I mentioned that the arch I
there found was a segment of a circle; but here it is very important
to observe that there are not only specimens of that, but also
one of the pointed arch. The latter, consisting of six stones, is
accurately drawn in the section. The stones are slightly hollowed
out to the shape of the arch, but do not advance beyond each other,
like the arch near the temple excavated out of the rock at Thebes,
but are supported only by _lateral pressure_.[30] The stones of this
arch are not joined with cement; but above the roof are a quantity
of small stones, which are kept together by a soft description of
cement. That these arches are not recently added, is proved, not only
by the appearance of the monuments themselves, being exactly of the
same description of fine hard sandstone, and of the same colour; but
still more certainly by the circumstance, that the portico I mentioned
as covered with cement, and painted in the ancient Ethiopian style,
is also, fortunately, arched. The interior of this arch is covered
with cement, which is harder than the stone, and painted.

The paintings on the arched roof, and the sides of the portico, are
evidently of the same period. As I have formerly observed, owing,
probably, to its very great antiquity, the painting is nearly defaced;
but still there was sufficient to convince me that the style is
certainly Ethiopian, of a far more ancient date than the sculpture
in the temple of Tirhaka.

_London. Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The reader will observe, also, in the section, a specimen of a
semicircular arch. They are drawn very small, as belonging to the
pyramids, but they are not, on that account, less accurate; and,
therefore, almost equally useful as if they had been made separate
plates. The stone forming the keystone of this semicircular arch is
1 foot 9 inches in length; the stones supporting it, corresponding
precisely, 2 feet 1 inch, and the one on each side following these,
to the spring of the arch, 2 feet 4 inches. The arch, then, not
only the circular, but the pointed, had its origin in Ethiopia. The
oldest known in Europe is, I believe, that in the Cloacum Maximum,
supposed to have been built in the time of the Commonwealth. The
great antiquity, of the one on the Tiber is proved by its singular
construction, forming almost, as it were, three arches beneath
each other.

I am aware that the learned will be sceptical concerning the
antiquity of these. There are no remains in stone to prove that
the Egyptians were so far advanced in the construction of the arch
as these specimens show that the Ethiopians were. The only stone
arch that exists in Egypt is the one at North Der, at Thebes; and
that one proves that the Egyptians were acquainted with its beauty,
but not its utility and the correct mode of constructing it. The
vaulted tomb of stones at Memphis is of the time of Psammitichus,
who reigned immediately after the Ethiopian dynasty. The brick
arches in the tombs at Thebes, covered with cement, on which are the
royal name of Thothmes and Amenoph, prove that the Egyptians were,
at that period, acquainted with the arch; but it is rather singular
that there is no earlier specimen: whence, I think, we may infer,
as those were built soon after the terrible wars commenced, which are
represented on the walls at Thebes, that the Egyptians then, for the
first time, invaded Ethiopia, and there saw and became acquainted with
that useful construction. There seems to me no reason to suppose that
the knowledge of the utility and construction of the arch passed from
Egypt into Ethiopia: the contrary is much more probable, as we have
here far more perfect specimens than are found in Egypt; and as there
is no doubt of the very great antiquity of these ruins, can there
be any, that the invention of the arch had its origin in Ethiopia?[31]

The sandstone of which the pyramids are built is of a much harder
quality than that of the temples, being either from a vein in the
mountain which is now exhausted, or, as I conceive is most probable,
brought from distant quarries. This is an extraordinary proof that
the greatest pains were taken in the construction of these edifices,
to enable them to resist the ravages of time.

As to the antiquity of these structures, I conceive it to be very
great. Some of them appear more ancient than any that exist in the
valley of the Nile, with the exception, perhaps, of the pyramids
of Meroe and Nouri. They are the tombs of a dynasty of kings
whose names are now unknown. That they were royal sepulchres,
and not those of private individuals, is, I think, evident from
their being as magnificent as the pyramids at Meroe, which we know
to belong to kings from the ovals which they contain; and many
of the individuals in these tombs have the serpent, the emblem of
royalty, above their foreheads. If this had been the site of Napata,
I should conceive that the dilapidated state of the ruins might have
been caused by Petronius, who led there the Roman arms; but in the
Historical Appendix I will give the reader a further account of that
celebrated expedition. I trust that the hieroglyphic inscriptions
which I have copied will contain much valuable information; and that,
at all events, the name of a place, evidently once so considerable,
may again, with certainty, be enrolled in the list of cities. Her
habitations and her palaces are utterly destroyed: the desert is
swallowing up the remains of her temples; and the sepulchres of her
kings are fast decaying. A city where the arts evidently were once
so zealously cultivated,—where science and learning appear to have
reigned,—is now possessed by ignorant barbarian tribes. Where are
the descendants of that people who erected these splendid monuments to
their gods? Were they exterminated by the warlike tribe who now occupy
this territory, driven into other regions, or blended with the race
of their conquerors? These are questions of great importance, which I
may endeavour to illustrate in my historical chapter, but which I pass
by at present, as scarcely belonging to a topographical description.

SCULPTURE IN A PYRAMID AT GIBEL EL BIRKEL.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

It is a circumstance, perhaps, worthy of remark, that some of the
most perfect heads sculptured on the pyramids had almost a European
profile. The Shageea—the brave tribe of Arabs who now possess
the magnificently rich and fertile plain near Gibel el Birkel, and
whose territory extends, on one side nearly to the fourth cataract,
and on the other to Dongolah—have, notwithstanding the darkness
of their complexion, nothing of the Negro features.

The inhabitants of the village of Birkel have their burying-place
on the edge of the desert. Two women died while we were there. On
such occasions the females of the village assemble in the house of
the deceased, to cry and bewail her death. Generally, after two or
three hours, they carry the body to the grave. On their arrival at
the burial-ground, they assemble round the corpse, and make a low
melancholy howl, and the nearest relations, with dishevelled hair
and loud lamentations, perform a kind of lascivious but graceful
dance; not very unlike that of the almæ in Lower Egypt, but the
movements here are different. They do not, like the almæ, remain
fixed to one spot, but move forward rather gracefully, bending their
knees and back, and throwing up their bosoms, keeping time to the
clapping of hands and their wild _lululoo_, of which there are two
descriptions, one expressive of grief, and the other of joy. This
dance is not so very indecent as the Egyptian dance. When the body
is laid in the ground, stones are erected over the head and feet,
between which they make a narrow channel, as I mentioned before,
filled with small pebbles, generally of quartz, but invariably of one
colour. I asked of several persons an explanation of this ceremony;
but the only reply was, “It was the custom.” Burckhardt states
(page 269.), that a fakeer told him that it was a mere meritorious
custom; that there was no necessity for it, but that it was thought
that the soul of the deceased, when hereafter visiting the tombs,
might be glad to find these pebbles, in order to use them as beads,
in addressing its prayers to the Creator.

In the centre of the burying-ground is a large tomb of a saint: this
is also built of stone. These stones are all taken from the temples,
but they are generally without sculpture or hieroglyphics. On one
stone, however, I discovered half of the name of Rameses II. or
Sesostris. This is curious, and reminded me that Strabo[32] speaks
of a sacred mountain in Ethiopia, where there was a temple of Isis,
built by that conqueror; and Herodotus says that Sesostris, that is,
Rameses II., was the only Egyptian king who made himself master of
Ethiopia. My accidental discovery of this name, is, I think, strongly
corroborative of the correctness of these two passages: this may
be the mountain alluded to. That conqueror must have constructed
some edifices, otherwise I should not have found his name. The
temple of Isis may be the one excavated in the rock, and afterwards
adorned with sculpture, by Tirhaka; and the statement of Herodotus,
that he was the only king who subdued the Ethiopians, is, I think,
proved by the fact, that, with the exception of the one which _may
be_ that of Amunneith III., on the column of the great temple, this
is the only name I have found of an Egyptian king either here or at
the Island of Meroe. I begged the katshef who governed the district
to desire the peasants to take the stones that they required from
the mountain, urging that, as strict Mahometans, they ought not to
take them from Pagan ruins; but, unfortunately, there is no law in
the Koran by which this is forbidden. Here, therefore, is another
cause which will contribute to the speedy and utter destruction of
what still remains of this interesting city.

To give the reader an idea of the present state of fertility of this
country, notwithstanding that the desert has enormously encroached
on the cultivated land, the following particulars may not be
uninteresting:—The katshef of Meroueh commands as far as Wanly,
down the river, one day by land, about thirty miles; and up the
river as far as Berber, two days by land. Within this small extent,
over which only the banks of the Nile are cultivated, there are 1368
water-wheels, which pay to the government twenty dollars each, that
is, 27,360 dollars; besides which, the government gain considerably
by obliging the peasants to plant indigo, which they purchase from
them at twelve piastres the cantar. They have calculated that they
make 190 drachms of indigo from each cantar. Under the government of
Dongolah, there are five manufactories of indigo,—Meroueh, Handek,
Haffeer, Dongolah Agous, and El Ourde. The manufactory here produces
1846 okres[33] every year, and is now increasing. The peasants are
unwilling to cultivate this plant, as the labour is very great; and
they do not consider the price they receive a sufficient remuneration.

The Shageea who cultivate this district are less oppressed than
their neighbours: they are, as Burckhardt and Waddington have
remarked, considered the bravest of the Arab tribes. This warlike
race alone never bent their knees to the great Sultan of Sennaar. It
is impossible to convey to the reader an adequate idea of the power
these daring warriors once possessed. The name of a Shageea was
a host in itself. I have been repeatedly assured, that a single
horseman has often been known to alight at a peasant’s hut, order
the owner to hold his horse, whilst he entered into his very harem,
ate with his wives, and often, it is said, still more shamefully
abused his power. Death or slavery was the fate of the meleks of
the neighbouring tribes who dared to offend them. Mounted on their
dromedaries or horses, armed with lances, swords, and shields,
they scoured the province, sweeping away the herds, massacring
all who had the courage to resist, and carrying away men, women,
and children into captivity. War was their sole delight; the cry to
arms their most welcome sound. Mothers appeased the cries of their
infants by the sight of a spear; and the lovely maiden only yielded
her hand to the distinguished warrior. Their exploits are the theme
of many a song; and other tribes seem to have forgotten their wrongs
in admiration of the bravery of their oppressors. The blessings of
peace, agriculture, and domestic repose were considered irksome by
these proud warriors. They obstinately and gallantly resisted the
invasion of the Pasha, till they found it vain, with their lances
and sabres, to contend against fields of artillery and disciplined
troops armed with the musket. Understanding that the Pasha was going
to make war against Melek Nimr and the Shendyans, who were also their
enemies, they joined his troops, and gradually came completely under
subjection to him. The government, however, treats them with some
respect. As I have stated before, a Shageea regiment is still in
the Pasha’s service, and engaged in the war against the Negroes,
at the southern extremity of his kingdom.

The ancient race of the meleks still exists, but the fortunes of
many are wofully changed. I took the portrait of one, an uncommonly
fine-looking fellow, who was constantly in the temple where I resided,
talking with my servants. (See Plate XXX.) His long gown, or shirt,
is called, in Arabic, _e’tobe_. The shawl, or _el melayah_,
is always put on very gracefully. Their sandals, or _nohel_, are
useful in walking on the sand, except when the latter is soft and
heated by the sun: they then afford them little protection, as their
feet constantly sink above the sole. As there was no barber in the
village, and I was told he had some skill in shaving, I allowed him to
officiate in that capacity; but most anxiously shall I avoid to have
my head again shaved by the son of a king. Never did I endure such
a scarification. His razor, one of the twopenny sort from Trieste,
was blunter than even a French table-knife; and he had no means
of sharpening it, but, according to the custom of the country,
on his bare arm. He drew blood four times, and scraped my head in
such a manner that it smarted for several hours afterwards; but it is
impossible to endure the wearing of one’s hair in this climate after
having once been accustomed to the luxury of having it shaved every
week; and having lost my penknife, I have been obliged to take my own
razor to cut my pencils. Travellers, in these unprovided regions, must
often have recourse to strange means of supplying their necessities.

Plate I. represents a Shageea with the dress of the desert—merely
a cloth around his waist: his colour is darker than the other, which
is accounted for from the life he leads, continually exposed to the
scorching sun.[34]

During our residence in the temple of Tirhaka we were often troubled
with wolves, attracted, I presume, by the smell of the meat, and
who made too free with our larder. Fatigued always by measuring
and drawing all the day under this burning sun, we slept too
soundly to detect the thief; indeed, the roaring of a lion would
scarcely have roused our Arab servants: but we had a guardian of
another description, whose instinctive vigilance proved fatal to
the intruder. The little monkey the Mahmoor of Berber gave me was
chained to, and had his bed among, a heap of stones in the corner
of the sanctuary where Mr. B. and I slept. The poor little animal,
frightened most desperately at the approach of so powerful an enemy as
a wolf, and, besides his bodily fear, having, of course, an interest
in the preservation of our larder, succeeded in rousing us by rolling
down the stones that were near it. It did this three nights together:
last night, one of my servants succeeded in shooting the thief.

CAMEL MAN OF THE ABABDE TRIBE.

SHAGEEA OF THE DESERT.]

_April_ 1. This afternoon we spent three hours in sailing eight miles
to the pyramids of Nouri. They are situated in a slightly elevated
part of the desert, a full half hour’s walk from the river. There
are traces of thirty-five pyramids, of which about fifteen only are
in any kind of preservation. These are not very interesting, except
as tombs, and from their imposing appearance, not being ornamented
with porticoes or hieroglyphic inscriptions. The pyramids are all at
right angles, and their direction is generally nearly the same. Their
size varies from 110 feet square to 20. (See plan, Plate XXXII., and
picturesque view, Plate XXXI.) There are eight above 80 feet square,
and four more above 70 feet square: their height is generally about
the same as their diameter.

Plate XXXI. is the most picturesque of three views which I made of
these pyramids; but the most remarkable for size does not appear in
this view. The plan will show that it measures at the base about
110 feet square. It consisted of three stages. Part of one having
fallen, discovers another pyramid underneath. They seem to have added
this second pyramid around the inner one, in order to increase its
size, or, perhaps, to make the body underneath doubly difficult to
get at. The Egyptian method of building pyramids with stages was,
I think, by first erecting a pyramid with a very acute angle, and
then building around it the first stage from the summit, and so on,
in like manner, as many as were required.

The pyramids are surrounded by the desert, which, I conceive, has
already covered the remains of several others. The waves of the great
Libyan ocean have probably swallowed up the traces of the city and
its temples, which, from the extent and imposing appearance of its
cemetery, must have been considerable. The interior of some of the
pyramids is of puddingstone, very much decomposed. The sandstone with
which these monuments are covered, and often constructed, is rather
soft, as is nearly all the sandstone in Ethiopia; which circumstance,
and also their very great antiquity, may be the reason, perhaps,
of the very dilapidated state of the ruins.

Close to these pyramids, and almost surrounding them, are the traces
of a canal from the Nile; which, according to my information, reaches
for a considerable distance into the desert. This circumstance proves
that the cultivated land extended much farther into the interior than
at present. Cailliaud supposed this place to have been the cemetery
of Gibel el Birkel; arguing that Thebes also had her tombs on the
opposite side of the river. But those of Gournah, and in the Valley
of the Kings, if not close to what formed part of the great city of
Thebes,—which, however, is very probable, from the numerous splendid
temples and palaces, of which there are still magnificent remains
on that side,—were, at all events, in the suburb, and exactly
opposite the great city, and not eight miles distant up the river,
as these are from Gibel el Birkel. Moreover, the tombs at Thebes
are on the western side, probably because the mountains on that
side are nearer to the river, and afforded greater facilities for
excavations than those of the eastern range. That the inhabitants
of Gibel el Birkel, therefore, should have chosen this place for
their necropolis, when they had space for hundreds on the spot where
her pyramids are now standing, or, at all events, might have erected
them, if they preferred it, immediately opposite on the western side
of the river, is an idea which no person who reflects on the subject
can entertain. They are most probably the tombs of another dynasty,
and of a city whose name may be among the many we meet with in the
itineraries. We may guess which of them it was; but such surmises,
without any proofs to support them, are entirely useless.

PYRAMIDS OF NOURI.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

I could not help drawing a comparison between these pyramids and the
celebrated ones at Geezah. The latter, although in a worse climate
and more exposed situation, have evidently suffered far less from
the ravages of time. There is scarcely one pyramid here which is
not so dilapidated that its architectural beauty is almost entirely
lost. The tropical rains seldom, if ever, reach so far north as
this province; yet numbers of the pyramids are quite destroyed, and
others are mere masses of shapeless ruins, without a vestige of their
ornaments remaining. From their appearance I should conceive these to
be the most ancient ruins in the valley of the Nile: but there are no
hieroglyphics remaining, to give us the name of the city or its kings;
and no sculpture, from the style of which we might have a better idea
of the period when they were constructed. This necropolis is now more
a place for the philosopher than the artist: the city and its people
are gone. The splendid mausoleums of its kings are little better
than piles of ruins: the histories which they recorded are lost for
ever. The dreary terrible desert which surrounds them seems silently
devouring its prey, and many ages will not elapse ere this, the real
Typhon, will have swallowed up every vestige of its ancient grandeur.

I conceive it not improbable that this is the site of the ancient
capital of this province, which may have been destroyed in the
wars between the Egyptians and the Ethiopians, perhaps by the great
Sesostris; and the city at Gibel el Birkel may have dated from its
ruin the increase of her magnificence. Succeeding generations may
have found the site of Gibel el Birkel more advantageous, and the
favour of a new dynasty of kings may have enabled the new capital to
eclipse her rival on the southern bank. I mentioned, after crossing
the Bahiouda Desert, and arriving at the Nile, that the peasants
informed me of some ruins which are now covered by the desert. I
conceive the existence of these to afford further confirmation of
the former opulence of this country. I cannot suppose, for a moment,
that the city to which this necropolis belonged was so far distant.

It is melancholy to see such numerous vestiges of imposing and
splendid structures, demonstrating the power, magnificence, and
knowledge of the former inhabitants of a province whose present
possessors scarcely have sufficient ability to construct for
themselves habitable mansions. The hovels of the peasants are
miserable in the extreme. The castles of the sheakhs are better,
but the rooms which they contain are extremely rude. This part of
Africa was formerly harassed by continual wars of one tribe and
nation against another. The necessity of guarding against surprise
obliged them to fortify their habitations, and having models in their
vicinity of ancient fortresses of the Ethiopians, the princes gave
to their residences a somewhat more tolerable appearance.

_April_ 3. We returned to Meroueh this morning, and I received
a visit from the katshef and his suite. His professed object was
to enquire whether he could be of any service to me, but his real
aim was chiefly to receive half the pay of the boat (120 piastres)
which he had procured for me, to take us to Nouri, and thence to
Dongolah. I paid him the money as he desired, but he did not take the
trouble of giving it to the rais (the captain of the vessel), who,
poor fellow, of course, said that it was all right, as complaint
would only have procured him the bastinado. This is the usual way
in which the government remunerate themselves for any pains they
bestow in making arrangements for travellers.

We started at twelve, and passed, this evening, Kajjib, an old
Arab village, picturesquely situated on a rock. We stopped for
the night at the ruin of an old Saracenic castle, called Baheet,
of considerable size, with towers and a citadel. It has evidently
been of great strength, the walls being very thick; the inner part is
built of brick; the exterior of stones piled together, as roughly as
the enclosing wall of a field in England. The rocks are of sandstone.

PYRAMIDS OF NOURI.

_London. Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

_April_ 4. We have this day passed the Island of Shenderab at half
past seven; the Island of Manderab at eight, the village of Korti and
islands of Ingolass and of Onato at half past eight; the small village
on the western bank, called Ambicol, at ten; the Island of Sennat at
one; the village of Defur at three P.M.; Genati at half past three,
and stopped for the night at the small Island of Bishaba.[35]

_April 5._ At seven we passed the village of Debba el Dolib; or,
as it is generally called, Debba, the commencement of the road
to Kordofan, and the last village of Dar Shageea. With all their
faults, the Shageea are the most interesting of the Arab tribes
I have seen. Their manly appearance, extreme valour, and open and
frank and noble manners, are very engaging; but I am sorry to find
that they are addicted to intoxication beyond any tribe I have
met with, spending the greater portion of their earnings in bouza,
and particularly in the strong spirit of the country distilled from
dates. Burckhardt (page 70.) has justly extolled their courage and
good faith, and hospitality to strangers that have friends among
them: but his account of their schools and learning would scarcely
be applicable to the Shageea of the present day, who are too much
enamoured of the dance and the cup to submit to the _ennui_ of study.

At half past seven we passed the Island of Geri, and a village
called Kutti, on the western bank. At half past four P.M. we passed
a small island called Amduburgh, and stopped soon after at Tangus,
another small island. The wind being invariably against us, we have
scarcely made any progress, and that only by tacking. The river is
about half a mile broad in this part of the valley, and occasionally
even wider. There is scarcely any cultivated land, except on the
islands. The desert, generally, on each side of the river, presents
not an object to cheer the eye or relieve the mind. When the banks
of the river were sufficiently low to afford us an extensive view,
we saw only immense tracts of waste bounded by the horizon. The
peasants chiefly inhabit the islands, where they seem to have taken
refuge from the encroachments of the desert, being seldom able,
with their inadequate means, to resist its approach; but, as I have
before mentioned, there are still some villages on the banks, like
little oases, but not so beautiful. Notwithstanding some advantage of
their situation, and their feeble efforts to protect their fields,
year after year the Libyan and Nubian deserts are said to extend
their sway.

The gravity of the Arabs, who seldom laugh, and scarcely ever,
even under the influence of intoxication, give way to boisterous
mirth, must be in a great measure attributed to the character
of their country. Considering these people as living under a sky
which is ever the same, clear and beautiful, and accustomed to one
uniform landscape, the river, its islands, and surrounding wastes;
knowing few other nations, creeds, or customs; having ever before
their eyes these dreadful wildernesses; experiencing their horrors,
and feeling their destructive effects; it is not surprising that
we find them more grave than the inhabitants of southern climes in
general. Even boys have the carriage and demeanour of men. Neat in
their dress and simple in their manners, there is no affectation,
no dandyism. How ill-placed would such follies be in a region like
this! Natural and easy in their address, erect in their carriage,
they often display a calm and noble dignity of demeanour, which
I have never seen surpassed in any civilised capital. They salute
you courteously, and talk with gravity of your plans. There is no
feverish anxiety to shine in conversation, nor any obligation to
converse with you. After the first compliments, unless any of them
have enquiries to make, they seldom speak. Every day is equally
beautiful and unclouded, therefore the weather is rarely, if ever,
the subject of conversation; and we have not, as in Europe, the bore
of discussing its appearance twenty times a day.

_April_ 6. At six A.M. we passed Ahmoor, a small village on the west
bank of the river, and at nine we arrived at Dongolah Agous.

_Dongolah Agous._—After having seen that Shendy, Berber, and
Metammah, though the capitals of provinces, are but miserable places,
I did not expect to find Dongolah otherwise; still I could not have
conceived that a town once so considerable, the metropolis of a
large district, whose name so often occurs in history, would have
presented now so wretched an aspect.

Part of the town is in ruins. The desert has entered into its
streets: many of the houses are entirely covered with sand, and
scarcely an inhabitant is to be seen. One might have thought that
some dreadful convulsion of nature, or some pestilential disease, had
swept away the population. Part of the city is, indeed, remaining,
but until I entered the houses not a human being did I meet with. I
observed some houses in the town, of a superior appearance, having
divisions of rooms, galleries, and courts, and evidently belonging
to individuals once rich; but they are now almost all deserted. In
some of them that we entered I saw some good-looking women: the men
were idling away the day smoking and sleeping. Such is the scene of
desolation and inactivity which now presents itself to the traveller
at Dongolah. The mosque used by the inhabitants, until recently,
was a large building, which tradition represents as very ancient,
and as being built 200 years before the Hegira: but it is evidently
of a much more modern date. It contains some granite columns, of
bad workmanship, belonging to the early Christian age.

I asked whether the residence of the Turkish government at El Ourde
was the cause why the city was so deserted, but was told that that
circumstance had made little or no change. This was the proud reply of
poverty. I have been informed by others, that, before the Pasha’s
conquest, many of the inhabitants were in better circumstances, and
the town more populous, but that they are now scattered elsewhere:
many of them fled to Kordofan and Sennaar, on the approach of
the Pasha.

I conceive it not improbable that this is the site of Napata. Pliny so
distinctly places that city 100 miles lower down the Nile than Gibel
el Birkel, that I see no reason for supposing that immense extent
of ruins to be the remains of a town which he describes as so very
insignificant. Besides the distance agreeing so exactly with Pliny’s
account, the position of Dongolah Agous, as a military station, to
resist the arms of Petronius, would certainly be advantageous. The
desert and the present city may have covered the vestiges of the
temples Petronius destroyed.

I left Dongolah Agous at three, without having made any drawings of
the place, not conceiving it worth the delay. At half past three we
passed the large Island of Gadar; at four, Ullow; and, after passing
numerous villages and islands, we stopped for the night at Gemin,
a very small village.

_April_ 7. We passed this morning the village of Handak, situated on
the western side near the base of the river, and the small Island
of Marouerti, which resembles rather the ancient name of Meroe,
and must, I think, be a corruption of it. Names analogous to that
of the ancient capital of Ethiopia seem to be given indiscriminately
to villages on the banks and the islands.

I saw this evening a number of slaves going to Cairo. The
manner in which they were clogged, to prevent their escaping or
rebelling against their owners, was disgraceful and revolting in
the extreme. Each slave wore a clog made of a wooden pole, four
feet long, with a collar, of a triangular form, large enough to
admit his head: this triangular collar rests upon their shoulders,
and is so contrived with straps that it is impossible for them to
throw it off. When they walk, they are obliged to carry it before
them; and at night their hands are tied to the centre of the pole,
and their feet to the bottom of it. The owners of the slaves showed
me, with the malicious grin of fiends, the effects of the cords,
and the weight of the machine on the hands, necks, and legs of their
victims. They confessed that they were often obliged to free their
slaves entirely from this torture, in order to preserve their lives:
I saw several in this situation, who seemed to have suffered severely
from being previously loaded with this machine.

I attempted to reason with one of the owners; and urged, that,
as he was obliged to leave them free occasionally, and run the
risk of their escaping, he might as well do so always, and that
he would find it his interest, as many actually died from this
treatment. I told him he ought, as a good Mahometan, to adopt a
more humane method of securing them. He told me, that he could not
liberate them all at once; for they had recently threatened that,
if ever they had the opportunity, they would kill him, and dye a
red _tarboush_ (Turkish cap) with his blood. The slaves understood
this part of our discourse, and some laughed at this expression; but
in general they appeared in a dreadful state of apathy and torpor,
quite indifferent to the interest they saw me take in their situation.

They were all negroes, with high cheek-bones, triangular faces, eyes
sunk deep in the head, thick lips, complexion a cold bluish black
colour, an expression heavy and unpleasing, and without a spark
of talent in their countenances. They were continually demanding
fire. After the extreme heat of the day, when the sun has set,
there follows a degree of cold, which, though slight, and to me
most agreeable, is no doubt felt severely by the slaves, who are
quite naked, and accustomed to a hotter climate; and they feel it
more sensitively, having been exposed the greater part of the day
to the burning sun. We make very little progress, the wind being
always strong against us.

_April_ 8. We passed to-day the village of El Urub. Nothing can be
more tedious and uninteresting than this voyage: we have scarcely
seen any cultivated ground since we left the town of Meroueh,
except the islands; the desert has almost entirely overspread the
banks of the Nile; and where there was once, perhaps, a happy and
numerous population, a people acquainted with the arts, rich cities
and villages, now no other track is to be seen but that of the
timid gazelle, which finds a secure pasture on the bushy acacias
which on each side border the river. The glaring reddish yellow
sands have supplanted the rich cultivation, and waves of sand have
swallowed up the vestiges of the temples and palaces which adorned
the cities. Where were the numerous towns whose names we read in the
itineraries? Are there no monuments remaining of their magnificence,
no traces of their habitations? The vessel buried in the fathomless
deep leaves but fragments which are soon covered by the waters. Thus
the Libyan and great Nubian deserts, ever active and incessant in
their attacks, have concealed entirely from our view the little,
perhaps, which the hand of time, and more destructive ravages of
war and religious fanaticism, had spared.


  “No trace remains where once thy glory grew:

   The sapp’d foundations by thy force shall fall,

   And, whelm’d beneath thy waves, drop the huge wall:

   Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore—

   The ruin vanish’d, and the name no more.”—POPE’s _Iliad_, book vii.


The rocks are of sandstone. There are some in the centre of the river,
whose channel, at this season, when the water is low, the barks
dare not navigate during the night, which they would otherwise do,
as there is then seldom any wind.

Our cabin being only three feet high, we are obliged to lie on our
beds day and night. I find this much more fatiguing than travelling
on the camels. For myself, I should never have chosen this mode
of conveyance; but my artist was in such a bad state of health,
that he declared himself unequal to the exposure to the heat and
the slow fatiguing pace of the caravan.

_April_ 9. Wind still contrary: no variety in the scenery. I will
not fatigue the reader with a mere list of names of villages, but
must refer him to my map, in which they are all marked down.

_April_ 10. There was no wind this morning; and we should have
arrived at Dongolah at nine, A.M., had we not received a visit from
a French physician in the employ of the Pasha. To meet a European,
in this country, is an occurrence so agreeable, that we could not
resist spending half the day together.

Some of the islands in this district are very rich. I remarked, on
one, numerous sugar-canes; and, in several, a mode of irrigating the
land unknown in Egypt, and displaying more skill than is usual in the
Pasha’s dominions. The ground near the Persian wheels is very often
uneven, and cannot be levelled without considerable labour: they,
therefore, form aqueducts with stakes or pieces of wood from one to
three feet high, as may be requisite, and place on them the conduit,
which is made of earth. These aqueducts are extremely picturesque,
as well as ingenious, being generally neatly constructed, and covered
with grass. All the watercourses in this country are attended to with
great care. The peasants are invariably well clothed, and appear
in easy circumstances. I observe them occasionally assembled in an
evening, under the palm trees, smoking, and sometimes drinking a
cup of Abyssinian coffee, their greatest luxury.

_April_ 11. The wind being still contrary, and my patience exhausted,
I sent for camels from Dongolah, five miles distant. The governor
there, understanding that we were travellers, immediately sent us
some of his own dromedaries.

_El Ourde, or New Dongolah.—April_ 10-14. We arrived here at
two o’clock, and immediately paid a visit to Ibrahim Effendi,
the governor of this province. He is a man about fifty-five years of
age, and of the most unprepossessing appearance: he stoops to such a
degree, that his head nearly touches his knees. I am told that he has
no talent, but has attained this important situation entirely through
the intrigues of the harem. He has, however, the character of great
probity—a rare virtue among Turks; and is disliked by the Copts,
because he examines rigidly their accounts, and will not allow them
to trade and speculate with the public money. He is despised by the
Turks, because he does nothing for them, and lives in no style. He
has only one Mameluke to give him his pipe and wait upon him. I saw
no other servants, but observed that a few soldiers were brought in
to make a show and line the walls. On his divan there were only a
few officers, apparently of inferior rank, and certainly of a very
shabby appearance.

M. Martin, a French apothecary, stationed here in the employ of the
Pasha, very kindly pressed us to take up our abode in his house;
and we were glad of the opportunity of enjoying, for a short time,
a greater degree of comfort and cleanliness than we have been
accustomed to for several months. He also assisted me in finding
the persons best qualified to give me information.

The Mahmoor, the day after our arrival, paid me a visit, was very
communicative, and made himself agreeable, to the astonishment of
Monsieur l’Apothicaire, and in the evening he sent me a roasted
sheep; an attention, I understand, that he never was guilty of before
to travellers or natives.

This government extends from Abka[36] to Wady el Gamer, near
Berber. There are 5000 sakkeas (water wheels), which generally
irrigate from four to five feddans each when planted with grain. The
indigo requires more water, for they calculate three quarters of a
feddan of land to one wheel. They produce in this province, 10,000
okres of indigo. Each water-wheel requires four oxen, and four or
five men and children. The population may, therefore, be calculated
at about eight for each water-wheel; which would make 40,000 for this
district; and I conceive 10,000 may be added for those who cultivate
the land by the hand, merchants, servants, &c. Some of the islands
have been planted this year, for the first time, with sugar-canes,
which have proved to be excellent; but they planted them without
reflecting that they had no machinery ready to manufacture sugar with,
and no person who understood the business. As the sugarcane requires
a water-wheel for each feddan, they do not intend to plant them
again. The governor obliged the peasants and soldiers to purchase
the sugar-canes at a certain price, in order that the revenue might
not suffer from the experiment.

There are some portions of the banks of the river, and particularly
the islands, which are cultivated after the inundation, and irrigated,
when necessary, by raising the water from the river with buckets
and other simple processes. Land irrigated in this manner is taxed
according to the quantity and description of produce. Each water-wheel
pays to the government 20 dollars, 15 in money and 5 in produce; a
heavy tax, when we consider that formerly, when under their native
meleks, they only paid 1 dollar, a sheep, and two pieces of linen,
value 6 piastres each; in all, little more than a tenth of the
present tax.

The revenue of this government, after paying the various expenses,
salaries, and the troops of the garrison, is greatly absorbed by their
having to furnish camels to convey the different species of produce,
such as indigo and grain, and slaves, which are sent to Cairo. In
particular, 2500 camels are loaded with gum, brought annually from
Kordofan. It is purchased from the peasants there at the rate of
5 dollars the camel-load, which consists of three cantars of 150
rotles[37] each; and the government sell it in Cairo for 20 dollars
the cantar; that is, 60 the load: deduct about 10 dollars for the
expense of the journey, and also 5 for the purchase-money, there
remain 45 dollars clear profit for the Pasha, which, on 2500 loads,
is 112,500 dollars net. Elephants’ teeth are also purchased in
Kordofan for 16 dollars the cantar, and sold in Cairo for 80 dollars,
and often more.

The government, as I have before stated, take part of the taxes in
grain: the following is a list of the prices paid by them, compared
to the current prices in the bazaar or market:—

           Government Prices.      Prices in the Bazaar.

              _s._    _d._            _s._     _d._

  Maize        3       9               3        0

The price of mutton (fat, for cooking) in the bazaar, is 1_d._
per rotle.

  Cotton, best kind (Belloe) per lb.       0      3

The dourah is sown before the rising of the Nile, and is cut in
four months; and afterwards they have another crop, but it is not so
good. The barley is sown after the Nile has retired, and is reaped
four or five months afterwards; wheat the same. The indigo plants
remain in the ground three years, and are cut three times each year,
with an interval of two months between each cutting. After dourah,
maize is planted, and after maize other kinds of grain.

Seven hours’ journey west of this place, amid the desert, is an
oasis called El Gab (the Wood), consisting of a forest of doums,
acacias, and some few date trees. It contains several springs, and
the Arabs send their camels thither in the summer to pasture on the
trees. This oasis has no antiquities nor traces of having ever been
inhabited; it extends, parallel with the Nile, nearly as far as Debba,
but, like all oases, is divided occasionally by the desert.

The caravans from this place to Kordofan, and on to Darfour,
enter the desert at Debba el Dolib, a village I mentioned in
descending the river from Meroueh. From Debba to Shambrick, five
days: the water there not always good; but on the road to Harazi,
five days, and thence to the capital, on digging to the depth of
two or three feet, and sometimes less, they never fail of finding
good water. Zaagsouee, eleventh day; Kadjama, twelfth day; the
residence of a katshef of Kordofan, Gouniah, thirteenth day; Mumat,
fourteenth day; Sherian-Abousieh, fifteenth day; Borah, sixteenth day;
Kordofan, or the capital, Ibazig, on the seventh day from Harazi,
and the seventeenth from the Nile, or Debba el Dolib.

I made repeated enquiries of both the Arabs and Turks, but did not
hear of there being any antiquities there. This journey would be
interesting for a naturalist, as they tell me that during the rainy
season there is a very great variety of birds: but it is then very
unhealthy. Ague and intermittent fevers are very prevalent. A French
physician, who had been stationed there some time, informed me that
during the rainy season he often took quinine in small quantities,
and conceived that, by that means, he had preserved himself from a
complaint which is so dangerous to Europeans.

The enterprising but unfortunate Captain Gordon fell a victim to
this climate.[38] I was told that he had visited several of the
mountain regions of Kordofan, and, to use the expression of the
Arabs, “had written down all the country.” He had commenced his
journey with the intention of endeavouring to discover the sources
of the Bahr el Abiad; but there was not the most remote chance of
his succeeding. Roustan Bey, who was then, and is now, the governor
of that country, would have allowed him to accompany his troops
in hunting for slaves in the neighbourhood of the White River. He
might have added something to our knowledge of the geography of the
country on that river; but to discover its source was impossible.

As a hint to future travellers, I should notice a mistake
which he made, from not being acquainted with the customs of the
country. Instead of making a handsome present to Roustan Bey of a
gold watch, or fire-arms, which he should have done, considering
the essential and extensive services he required, he gave him some
gilt ornaments for his wives: but the Turks having a great contempt
for any article that is not genuine, the Bey was naturally vexed
at a present which appeared to him so very insignificant. Captain
Gordon was not to blame, I understand, but his dragoman, for
this inauspicious commencement of their expedition. The Arabs and
Turks say that Captain Gordon died on account of having taken too
much physic. In a country where so much is left to nature, and the
medical art so little known, it is not surprising that his frequent
applications to his medicine chest, to relieve a severe attack of
intermittent fever, should have given rise to this report.

Before leaving Dongolah, this unfortunate traveller left a large
sum of money with a Turkish aga in whose house he lodged. When his
servant, after his death, returned to Dongolah, he called upon the
aga, and demanded his master’s property. The Turk, a notorious
scoundrel, proposed to the servant to divide the money and property,
and thus induced him to sign a certificate that his master had
left only a few old clothes, and no money. As soon as the Turk had
received this document, he refused to give any portion of what he
had promised to the servant; who, in revenge, accused him before the
government. I was not able to learn with certainty whether the money,
and, what was of far more consequence, his papers, ever reached his
friends. I purchased at Dongolah a piece of Newman’s Indian ink,
which formerly belonged to him.

I obtained from authentic sources the following information of the
different Arab tribes in the kingdom of Kordofan and its vicinity:—

_The Kababysh._ These Arabs are also found in the Bahiouda
Desert. They possess camels and horses, and transport merchandise
to Sennaar, Darfour, and to this place. Their chief is called
Melek Selim.

_The Buggara._ They possess flocks, and are occupied in hunting the
elephant and the giraffe. Moussa is their chief.

_The Benigerar_ have great abundance of horses and camels. They
are generally engaged in transporting merchandise, sometimes to
Darfour. They are often at war with the Kababysh.

_The Hammer_ are chiefly cultivators of the ground. They possess also
camels, and trade to Darfour, but do not come to this place. They are
occupied also in tanning the skins of animals, and the government
employs them in their hunting expeditions for slaves. Their arms
resemble those of the other Arab tribes,—the oval spear, the lance,
and sword. Hadji Merien is their chief or king, that is, melek.[39]

_The Hadowyeh_ are cultivators, and join the expeditions of the
government like the Hammer: they possess good dromedaries, and their
melek is Uhmar, son of Dowel.

_Messabouee._ Cultivators, and also assist the government in their
slave expeditions: their melek is Uhmar, son of Hashim.

_Danaglih._ Peasants of the country; cultivators.

_Konjarah._ A tribe from Darfour: the masters of the country, under
Magdum Selim, on the arrival of Roustan Bey, who killed their chief
in battle[40]: their present chief is Sultan Tema.

The province of Kordofan is exceedingly productive to the Pasha,
and so also would Darfour be; and ere now that province would
have been annexed to his kingdom, had not his ambitious views been
turned towards Constantinople. A desert, I am told, of five days’
journey separates the two provinces. He might extend his conquests
thither without any apprehension of interference from the European
powers. If the peace in Syria continues, and Mohammed Ali lives,
that country, notwithstanding the warlike and powerful tribes who
inhabit it, will soon form a part of the Pasha’s immense dominions;
and Europeans will be enabled to explore it with greater advantage
than our celebrated traveller Brown.

Dongolah, or New Dongolah, as I should call it, has far more the
appearance of a capital, than any place I have seen in Ethiopia. The
citadel is fortified with walls and towers sufficient to defend
it from the attacks of the Arabs, but not long against a European
army. There are a few pieces of cannon brought here by Ismael Pasha,
and there is generally a garrison of from 300 to 800 men, but most
commonly from invalid regiments, that have suffered by the more
unhealthy climates of Kordofan, Khartoun, and Sennaar, and are sent
here as fit for no other service. They have built an hospital, but,
although full of invalids, it is not yet finished,—the rooms are
without roofs, and the beds of earth.

There are several _cafés_ in the town, much better than I expected:
one is very handsome; large, airy, and furnished with a divan
covered with carpets. Here the lazy Turks kill the day: smoking,
seeing the people pass by, playing draughts and other games, and
drinking coffee and sherbet.

The bazaar is superior to that of Assuan. The articles for sale
consisted of different stuffs, silk, linen, and cotton; tarboushes
(red Turkish caps), shoes, glassware, cures for ophthalmia (some
of which seemed on examination to contain zinc); and a variety of
pipes, from the handsome Persian anguilles and long Turkish pipes,
with their amber mouthpieces, worth two or three pounds each, to
the humble pipe of the peasant, value threepence: coarse thread and
common needles; salt, from the mines of Selima, white and beautiful
like crystal; a variety of cases for amulets, such as the women wear
around their necks and the men on their arms (see the various plates
of costumes); coffee from Mocha and Abyssinia; loaf sugar, white and
brown; tamarinds from Sennaar and Kordofan; and a variety of arms,
sabres, lances, daggers, and pistols; and in every shop on sale,
spices and ginger, cloves, coriander seed, sandal wood, and a kind of
kernels, seemingly of cherries, which are said to come from Italy;
the natives extract oil from them. With the spices they make the
ointment which both males and females, particularly the latter,
use in this country to render their skin soft. I have seen them
sometimes almost naked, and smeared with this substance as if they
had been dipped in butter; and I have often seen the Arabs of the
desert place two or three pounds of mutton fat on their heads, and
walk on till the sun had melted it, when not only the head and face
were covered with the liquid grease, but it flowed in streams down
their backs. They consider their different ointments as particularly
conducive to health, especially after fatigue. There is an old custom
still kept up in the country. When an Arab or Turk arrives in a
village after a fatiguing day’s journey, he generally gets some of
the female slaves I have spoken of at Shendy, to rub him for half an
hour all over with this ointment. It is very pleasant and refreshing,
cooling and softening to the skin, which has been burnt and dried up
by the scorching winds of the desert. I also observed in the bazaar
common looking-glasses, and beads of glass and other materials.

There were several separate markets for slaves, men, women, boys,
girls, and eunuchs. Most of the latter are from Abyssinia. I am
informed that they are generally the victims of the brutality
of the Abyssinians of neighbouring states. Besides increasing
the value of their slaves, they appear to wish to imitate the
ancient Egyptians, whose cruelty in that respect is explained in
the triumphant procession on the walls of Medenet Abou, at Thebes. I
saw one extremely beautiful Abyssinian girl on sale for 150 dollars,
and for another not remarkable for her beauty 80 were demanded.

I observed a custom, which is peculiarly characteristic of this
district: the peasant girls, and also the men, bring from the country
small quantities of grain and other produce, which they exchange for
perfumes and spices for their hair and persons. This is conformable
to our European idea of remote and uncivilised people, carrying on
commerce simply by barter. They showed me in the bazaar some rudely
shaped pieces of iron, said to be the money of Darfour.

Some of the peasant girls buying spices in the bazaar were
very pretty. I told one, that had she been a slave I would have
purchased her. She laughed at my compliment, and replied, with great
_naïveté_, that, upon her conscience, she was no slave.

To make a purchase in the bazaar is sometimes rather difficult. I
asked one of the merchants the price of a pipe, which I thought of
buying. The man was confused, and could not make up his mind how
much he ought to ask; but, seeking to enhance its value by praise,
without replying to my question, he continued to extol its different
excellencies. The other merchants pressed him to name a sum. The
man was very much embarrassed, particularly as we had desired him to
state the lowest at which he could sell it, otherwise we should not
treat with him. It was only, however, when he saw me walking away,
that he could resolve to ask only twice the value of the article. It
is the custom here for the purchaser to bid, and not for the merchant
to name the price. If the offer does not equal his expectations,
he says, _Eftah Allah!_ “May God open your eyes!” or, “May
God improve your judgment!”

I went into a shop in which there was a shabbily dressed
common-looking fellow squatted on the ground, with a few miserably
rude tools before him, on a board. I conceived he might be a joiner,
and must confess I was rather surprised at finding that he was the
first goldsmith in Dongolah. They cannot work European gold. They
generally employ the gold of Sennaar, which is of a superior quality,
being pliable and malleable, like lead. This man told me that my
watch was not gold, for he had never seen gold so dark-coloured.

They have a custom here, as well as at Cairo, of selling merchandise,
such as clothes, &c. by auction in the street. The auctioneer walks
about, calling aloud the price. One makes an offer, and the man walks
on; another meets him, who likes the article, and bids higher. The
owner promotes the sale by giving occasionally a bidding himself.

The crowds in this bazaar, as compared with the deserted streets of
Berber, Shendy, and Metammah, and the variety of costumes worn by
Turks and Caireens, Fellaheen (or, as they are more properly called
here, Dongoloue), Bishareen, Ababde, Shageea, and other tribes,
formed a scene gay, and not unpleasing, particularly after the
solitudes of the desert.

The costumes of Dongolah are somewhat different, but, perhaps,
less remarkable, than any I have seen in Ethiopia. The women, when
they are married and have had children, have their hair dressed on
each side of their face, in three rows of ringlets, or tresses, the
lowest often reaching to their shoulder. The other females are only
permitted to wear two rows. The head-dress of the women of Shendy is
rather different: they wear their hair loosely projecting from each
side and behind, while on the top of the head it is quite flat. But
what is most extraordinary in the costumes of this country is the
inimitable grace and elegance with which their robes are adjusted,
often almost equalling the drapery of the ancients. Were it possible
to collect correct drawings of their almost innumerable methods of
folding their _melayah_, the large long piece of linen cloth which
forms their chief, and often only, covering, I question if such
drawings would be believed any thing else than copies of the Greek
and Roman draperies, or studies of ancient costume. A sculptor would
assuredly call them walking statues.

The young girls, before being married or having arrived at the age
of discretion, only wear the rat, the Nubian covering, composed, as
already mentioned, of thin thongs of the hide of the hippopotamus,
which reaches from the waist almost to the knee, and is coquettishly
ornamented with masses of silver, and a variety of shells and
beads. It is considered sufficiently modest in this country, where
no consequence is attached to the exposure of the body and limbs;
otherwise, so far as it extends, it forms an elegant and impenetrable
skreen. (See girl in Plate XXXVII.) The changing of this costume,
or breaking of their rat, upon their marriage, is rather a curious
ceremony, which I will presently describe; but when the rat is torn
merely on account of the advanced age of the girl, and not at her
marriage, only a sheep is killed, and she and her relations receive
the congratulations of their hungry friends.

Skins of animals are often exposed for sale in the bazaar, but they
are generally too ill prepared to be of any use for stuffing, often
wanting the most essential parts, such as the feet, and even the
head. Had I been half an hour earlier there, on the day of my arrival,
I could have bought for four shillings the skin of a giraffe. This
animal, only so recently known in Europe, is found in great numbers
on the road from Debba to Kordofan, between Sabrian and Gibel el
Arazi, and behind Kordofan, on the Bahr el Abiad, the territory
of the Buggara tribe. The government do not encourage the Arabs
to seek for them. On the contrary, without an express permission
from the Pasha, no Arab, Turk, or traveller is allowed to purchase
one. When the peasants catch them for the government, they receive
a remuneration of twenty-five dollars, which is considered very
handsome. Had I been provided with a permission from the Pasha,
I was told that I should have had little difficulty in procuring
one at that price. At the time of the _haref_ (the rainy season),
the Hassanyeh retire with their herds and camels into the mountains
and valleys, which afford ample pasture for their cattle for three
or four months. They protect themselves from the little rain that
falls with _shambries_ (tents made of goat skins). During this season
the chase also contributes to their support. When there is no rain,
which is very often the case, the sun, being then almost vertical,
produces a heat so excessive that the gazelles, giraffes, ostriches,
&c. are said to become much less capable of escaping pursuit than
during winter. The Hassanyeh then on their swift horses catch them
without much difficulty.

This tribe (Hassanyeh) is very extensive, and trade to Kordofan;
and great numbers of them in this neighbourhood convey merchandise
to Assuan. They are very fine-looking fellows, more grave in
their manners than even the Arabs in general. They wear their hair
plaited, and tight behind; differing, in this respect, from any other
tribe. (See Plate XXXIX., in which they are represented straining the
common bouza of the country through a straw funnel.) I have travelled
with several of them, and liked them exceedingly. In the same tracts
with the giraffe is found also the antelope, or, as it is called, the
cow of the desert (_buggera el Atmoor_), with straight and twisted
horns (see Plate XXXVII.); also gazelles in abundance. The elephant
is found in Abyssinia, and, it is said, also above Sennaar, in the
province of Fazoql, and in that of the Buggara, behind Kordofan. There
are a great many of the gemet cat in this neighbourhood. They have
small thin heads, long backs of a grey colour, with brown spots, and
a black streak along the centre. Some of them are eighteen inches
long, besides the tail, which measures twelve inches. The colour
of the latter is alternately grey and black. Mr. M. had several in
cages: when set at liberty in a room, they seemed to be very timid,
and one of them was rather savage. Their velocity is extraordinary.

MARRIAGE AND OTHER CEREMONIES OF DONGOLAH. — CHARACTER OF THE
PEOPLE, THEIR HABITATIONS. — WOMEN, THEIR AMUSEMENTS. — ARAB
TALE. — GOVERNMENT OF DONGOLAH.


An account of the ceremonies of marriage, &c. in this part of
the interior of Africa may not be uninteresting to the reader,
as differing much from those we are accustomed to, and elucidating
the manners of the present inhabitants of Ethiopia. Though I travel
for the purpose of studying the remains of the ancient grandeur of
these realms, I omit no opportunity of observing the customs of the
present inhabitants, their condition and government.

The ceremonies of marriage vary in a slight degree in almost every
district of the valley of the Nile; but in no place are they more
curious than in the province of Dongolah. The nuptial ceremony
of every country appears singular in another. The Arab would be
astonished at the solemnity of our weddings, particularly at the
weeping which sometimes takes place, although, perhaps, he would
have no objection to the plum-cake; and, if impatient to possess
his treasure, would not dislike the marriage _sans façon_ by the
blacksmith at Gretna Green. Our customs would appear as strange
to him as even the following description of an Arab wedding to a
British reader.

As soon as a Dongaloue has collected a small sum, sufficient,
according to his condition, to defray the expenses of the fête, he
looks out for a girl suited to his taste. Having fixed his choice,
he sends two persons to make his proposals to her father, or whatever
relation has charge of her. When he is accepted, and the friends
on both sides agree to the wedding, he sends his intended bride a
variety of presents; the _gourbab_, or drapery of linen which they
wear around their waists, and also other pieces of wearing apparel,
shawls, and linen; and, besides these gifts, he sends her also money,
wood, and, according to his fortune, from four to forty ardebs of
grain. Accompanied by his friends, he then goes to the house of
the bride; her father meets him at the door, and in the presence
of the cadi, and of the relations and friends of both parties, and
of the fakeers of the village (men who can read and write a little,
and have the reputation of being pious Mahometans), the father gives
away his daughter, and the bridegroom receives the gift. “I give
you my daughter for wife:”—“I take your daughter for wife,”
is all that passes; the cadi and other witnesses of the contract then
invoke God and the Prophet to bless their union. In the mean time the
girls and matrons of the village are inside the house with the bride.

The cadi having witnessed the agreement and taken his departure,
the father of the girl invites the bridegroom into the house. A
curious scene then commences, which baffles description: the female
friends of the bride, having hid her in some secret room, as soon as
the bridegroom enters, rush upon him, and begin pulling him about,
and pinching him, often not in the gentlest manner. The husband hunts
in every direction for his bride; but her friends, first drawing him
on one side, and then on the other, and pinching him unmercifully,
fully occupy his attention, and prevent his making the discovery. At
length, worn out with fatigue, and having supported his character by
fighting as good a battle as he was able, he gives them a handsome
present of money to inform him where she is. Then commences another
ceremony—the tearing of the rat, or cincture, as I have already
mentioned. The rat, on this occasion only, is protected and covered
with folds of linen, tied and knotted in the most complicated
manner. The bridegroom endeavours to undo this Gordian knot, amidst
the laughter of the bride and her friends: but the latter are not
merely idle spectators; they commence again pulling him about, and
pinching him most maliciously. The bride also does not omit the
opportunity of giving him slily an affectionate pinch or two. At
last, he is obliged to purchase again the assistance of the girls;
and they generally make him pay dear. If his first present is not
sufficiently liberal, they continue tormenting him until he has
satisfied their expectations.

The women having taken off the covering that protected it, the
bridegroom seizes the rat, and tears it in pieces; the bride, on this
occasion only, has a piece of linen underneath; yet it sometimes
happens that the wicked bridegroom succeeds also in snatching away
this under-covering, and turns the laugh against his bride; this,
however, is considered here little more than a harmless jest.

For seven days they continue feasting and dancing. The bride generally
keeps her face covered during this time, but the bridegroom is
permitted to laugh and practise with her what we should call rather
rough jokes, as their chief amusement seems to be pinching. On the
seventh evening, the bridegroom conducts his bride to his house,
and another curious custom is practised. The male friends of the
husband and the female friends of the bride assemble around a large
board, on which a great quantity of grain or dates is placed. When
the signal is given, the parties commence a scramble, each striving
most earnestly to collect the largest quantity. If the women succeed,
the wife is to rule her husband; if the contrary, the husband is to
be master of his own house. If this ceremony took place in Europe,
the men, through indolence and politeness, and being engrossed
in various pursuits, not to say deference for the good sense and
peculiar talents of the fair sex in managing domestic affairs,
might gladly cede the greater quantity to the women; but here it is
considered too great a disgrace for a man to relinquish any portion
of his authority to his wife, to admit of such courtesy.

When they name their children, there is very little ceremony: four
days after the birth the name is given, and a sheep is killed for
the fête.

The ceremony of the circumcision of the male is also curious: it
takes place when the child is about four or six years of age. All
the friends and relations of the family assemble at the house
of the father, bringing with them presents according to their
means,—horses, oxen, cows, corn, money, &c. After partaking of
some refreshment, they walk in procession to the river, and all
the males bathe together. On their return to the house, the child
is placed on an angoureeb, and the ceremony performed. A bunch of
flowers is then placed in his hand, with scents, and the relations
and friends pass the one after the other, kiss and smell the bouquet,
and give the child as liberal a present as they can afford. There
is, generally, so great a mixture of persons on these occasions,
that these gifts vary from upwards of two pounds to one penny:
all, however, are expected to give as much as they can afford. In
Egypt they often postpone this ceremony until the child is twelve
or fourteen years of age; but in this country the family gain so
large a sum by it, that they seldom if ever delay it so long. For
the girls there is no fête: at most they merely kill a sheep. This
ancient ceremony probably had its origin in this country. Herodotus,
after mentioning that the Phœnicians and Syrians derived the custom
from the Egyptians, seems to doubt whether the Egyptians had it from
the Ethiopians, or the Ethiopians from the Egyptians.

I described a funeral at Gibel el Birkel in Dar Shageea. Here, also,
they sometimes dance on these occasions, but not often. It is an old
custom, and not considered strictly Mahometan. Both sexes are buried
on the very same day that they die, generally a few hours afterwards.

The contests which took place between the Arabs of the mountains and
the Berberene peasants, cultivators of the land, are suppressed by the
authority of the Turkish rulers; but their contempt for each other is
often displayed. When an Arab of the desert is oppressed by a soldier,
his first exclamation is, “Do you take me for a Berberene?” The
latter, in return, pride themselves on not being obliged to lead
the vagrant lives of the wandering Arabs. The peasants of Dongolah
are extremely honest: no bar nor lock is necessary, to secure the
door against the thief; nor is falsehood known among them. They
are always hospitable to the extent of their means. I never saw a
peasant sit down to eat, without inviting all that were near him to
take a share; and the poor and fatigued traveller is never refused
a night’s lodging and an evening meal.

The inhabitants of Upper Nubia have been so many years accustomed
to the Turks, that white men are now no longer looked upon with
horror. Burckhardt tells an amusing tale, that, in the bazaar
at Shendy, he raised his turban, and showed his white shorn head
to a peasant girl, who, I suppose, had never seen flesh so white
before, and, terrified at the sight, exclaimed, “Um del Allah min
Shatan!”—“May God preserve me from the Devil.” This is one
of their favourite expressions; but the white man now incurs no risk
of having it so peculiarly applied to himself.

Most of the houses of the peasants are of mud, that is, the alluvial
soil of the Nile, mixed with cow and horse manure; the latter is
much used: straw is rarely added. Many of the houses in the country,
built of dourah straw, are extremely picturesque. The two views
(Plates XXXVI. and XXXVII.), taken from nature, will give the reader
a good idea of their construction, and also their inhabitants. The
lordly Turk is smoking on the only angoureeb in the house; one man
is grinding on a stone, for his lazy wife, whose business it is
considered to be, merely as much dourah as will suffice for their
mid-day and evening meal; and others are occupied in making and
drinking their favourite beverage the bouza. I have already noticed
the graceful style of the costumes both of the men and women; the
latter are often handsome, having fine forms and a good expression.

The wives are generally virtuous and gay: the dance is their favourite
amusement, but not so much indulged in here as in the province of
Dar Shageea. Their greatest delight is listening to the tales of
the country, which, though simple, are full of imagery, and have,
in the Arab language, a peculiar charm. A translation, I fear,
cannot give a full idea of their beauty. The following is a tale I
heard related by a little Ababde girl of thirteen; and even at an
earlier age their memories are stored with similar stories, which,
if any one had the disposition and the leisure to collect them,
would form a considerable and not uninteresting supplement to the
Thousand and One Nights.


                            DONGOLAH TALE.


“Amnah was the most lovely of the daughters of the Nile: fair as the
sand of the desert, the gazelle was not more elegant in form, or more
graceful in its movements. Her bust was beautiful, and her skin soft
and pliant to the touch. Her face was as the light of day; her eyes
were bright as the stars; her teeth whiter than the polished ivory;
and a lovely and ever-constant smile illumined her countenance. Nature
had done her utmost; Fortune equalled her rival in loading her with
its favours. Her necklaces were numerous, and of the finest gold;
and great was the weight of gold on her wrists and ankles. Her hair
was beautifully plaited, and decorated with the largest and rarest
pearls, and broad plates of gold above her forehead; and two large
and most precious ornaments set with diamonds hung gracefully from
her ears. Her rat (cincture) presented every variety of colour; the
skin of the hippopotamus was never cut so fine: it was ornamented
with the most curious shells and pieces of gold and silver attached
coquettishly in the most becoming manner; and the border of the rat
around her waist consisted of coral and pearls. From her waist to her
knees, only, this graceful ornament skreened her form; and there was
not one of the youths of the village and of the neighbourhood, who
had ever seen Amnah, who did not sigh and regret bitterly his being
unworthy that her rat should be broken for him. ‘The houries of the
paradise of the prophet cannot,’ said they, ‘be more enchanting,
endowed with such ravishing beauty, or such extraordinary talents.’

INTERIOR OF A DONGOLAH COTTAGE.

“She was, at the same time, the gayest of the gay, and also
acquainted with all the learning of her tribe. Her father and other
travellers had related to her the history and customs of other
countries, and from them she had learnt the traditions and wars of
her native land. Every passage of the Koran was familiar to her;
and it was whispered she had devoted herself secretly to the study
of astrology (el ahlem el felek), and the more hidden sciences
of the Arabians. At midnight she was often seen alone, gazing at
the heavens; and for this reason the nomage she received for her
beauty and understanding was blended with a certain feeling almost
approaching to fear. Too beautiful, pure, and learned to be of this
world, she was considered by the ignorant peasants more as an angel
of light (melik e’ nour), than a frail inhabitant of earth.

“At the death of her father, after she had accompanied his remains
to the grave, and for some time had lamented his loss, Amnah, weary
of the constraint to which her sex subjected her, and anxious to
visit those scenes which she had so often heard described, left her
native village. The morning after her departure, at the entrance of
a small town, she observed an old man covered with vermin. ‘My
father,’ said she, ‘let me free you from those tormentors;’
and she began killing the animals, until suddenly the man fell
dead at her feet. ‘It is the will of God!’ she exclaimed, and
immediately dressed herself in his clothes, and pursued her journey.

“Thus disguised, and safe by the power of magic from detection,
she procured a dromedary swift as the wind, and visited the different
regions she had heard described; sometimes joining one caravan,
and sometimes another. The immense treasures on her person were
little diminished by this expense; when, one day, the people of
the caravan with which she travelled perceived a cloud of sand
approaching them, and shortly afterwards distinguished a troop of
horsemen at full gallop. Amnah and her companions urged on their
camels, but, finally, finding flight useless, they endeavoured to
hide themselves in a large well, which the heat of the summer had
dried up. But the horsemen had seen them enter, and, delighted to
have their prey secured, they offered to the young leader of their
band his choice, whether he would have for his portion the first or
the last of the persons whom they should find in the well.

“Their chief, named Mustapha, was only twenty-one years of age,
but renowned for his skill in the use of the matchlock, the sabre,
and the lance. His shield, of the hide of the hippopotamus, was almost
useless; for with his sabre he parried the blows of his enemies;
with a slanting cut of his Damascus blade, which his father, who
had travelled far towards the north, had brought him, he separated
the limbs of his foes, and even severed the iron chain. At the shake
of his lance all fled before him; and never was a matchlock in more
skilful hands. In form, he was the perfection of manly beauty and
vigour, and his mind was richly endowed, displaying a judgment beyond
his years, and greater presence of mind in danger than the oldest
warrior. The Koran he knew by heart, and his chief delight was in
listening to the traditions of his country. Young and generous,
he could never repress his indignation at the recital of the evil
deeds of the tyrants who had reigned over the land: his eyes kindled
with enthusiasm, and his cheeks glowed with pleasure and emulation
when they told him of the valorous exploits of his ancestors, their
generosity and hospitality. Like the rest of his race, much of his
time was spent in excursions against the tribes with whom they were
at war.

“Perceiving where the caravan had taken refuge, Mustapha, having
the first choice allowed to him, said, ‘I will take for my share
the captive at the extremity of the well: he who has most to lose
will have fled the farthest.’ His companions cast lots for their
portions. Some had young women, others young active male slaves;
all with some treasure. None were apparently so unfortunate as
Mustapha, who found at the extremity of the well Amnah disguised as
an old man, miserably clad, the picture of poverty. His companions,
with the freedom of friends, rallied him on the wisdom of his choice,
in the following lines, which one of them sang, and the others joined
in chorus[41]:—


  ‘Our chief, what wisdom he has shown!

   God has blessed him with great judgment.

   O, what a prize he has gained!

    So young and so active a slave;

    So splendid and costly his dress;

    So sweet the scent of his body!

  Our chief,’ &c.


    ‘He will lead your horse to the field;

     Give you your lances in battle,

     And ward off the treacherous blow.

   Our chief, what wisdom he has shown!

   God has blessed him with great judgment.

   O, what a prize he has gained!’


“Mustapha bore good-naturedly the jests of his companions, and,
not wishing to appear to despise the gift of Providence, although
apparently useless, he led to his castle, as prisoner, the disguised
Amnah. On his arrival, he asked her what she could do: ‘Can you cut
wood?’ said he. ‘No,’ replied Amnah, ‘I have no strength:
see you not that my arm is shrivelled up with age?’ ‘Can you
carry it?’ said the chief. ‘No,’ she said, ‘my back is already
double; I should sink under the lightest weight.’ ‘Can you guard
the cows, or sheep?’ ‘Alas, no!’ replied Amnah, ‘they walk
too fast and far for me.’ ‘Can you clean the horses?’ ‘I
know not how.’ ‘Can you wash the sand for gold-dust?’ ‘My
eyes are not good enough.’ ‘You are too dirty to make bread. Can
you attend the geese?’ ‘I think I can,’ said Amnah; ‘at all
events, I will try.’

“Mustapha gave her for her companion a dumb youth, called
Yabebe. After some days, when Yabebe was bathing in the river,
Amnah took off her disguise, and showed herself, to the astonished
peasant, as the perfection of beauty, covered with gold and precious
stones, her hair ornamented with fine pearls and plates of gold,
and her earrings studded with diamonds: laughing, she sang to him
the following lines[42]:—


  ‘Open your eyes, Yabebe:

   See! I am young and lovely,

   Covered with gold all over;

   My necklace of gold,

   My earrings of gold,

   My bracelets of gold,

   And gold round my arms,

   And gold round my legs,

   Gold on my forehead,

   And gold on my rat;

   Pearls and silver also.

   Open your eyes, Yabebe;

   See, I am young and lovely,

   Covered with gold all over!’


“The astonished peasant left the river, and Amnah, laughing,
resumed her disguise. On his return to the castle, the dumb youth made
signs to his chief that Amnah was a woman, beautiful, and covered
with gold. They surveyed her, and, not finding out her disguise,
beat the boy for his improbable falsehood.

“The day afterwards they were at the same river: Amnah threw aside
her disguise, put her ornaments together, and bathed herself, with the
lad, in the shaded stream. The peasant went first out of the water,
and unobservedly stole one of her rings. Amnah, having counted them,
found one missing. Yabebe denied having taken it. Amnah beat him,
but still he denied, and, escaping from her, fled to his master, and
gave him the ring, describing, by signs, that she had similar ones on
all her fingers, and was covered with gold and precious stones; that
she was a woman, and that her beauty was, as the mid-day sun (jemeel
mittel e’ shamps fel dohr), too powerful to gaze at. Mustapha sent
for Amnah, and, flying suddenly upon her, tore open the rags that
covered her, but fell senseless at the sight of such exquisite beauty.

“Great was the fête of the marriage, countless the camels and sheep
that were killed. The music was incessant for seven days and seven
nights, and they danced until they could dance no more. None, for
many years, saw the brilliancy of her face, being ever in her harem,
or closely veiled, when, occasionally, she appeared in public. The
fame of her beauty, knowledge, and goodness was spread through all
lands; the learned were anxious to converse with her; but none,
except her husband, had seen her face.

“One day her dearest son fell from a tree that he was climbing. His
cries reached the ears of his anxious mother. Without a veil,
without a garment, she rushed forth. The crowd, on seeing her,
fell as dead. They knew not if the effect was produced by magic,
or by the power of her exquisite beauty. At her touch her son was
restored; and, having clothed herself with a gourbab, and thrown a
veil over her head, the crowd recovered; but the tree withered from
that day: the branches decayed fast; the leaves fell on the ground,
and it no longer afforded shade.”


                  THE ANCIENT GOVERNMENT OF DONGOLAH.


The Meleks who formerly reigned here were of the Zebain, to which
tribe belong almost all these rulers, including Melek Tumbol,
Melek Nazr e’ Deen, and, in fact, all those from Sennaar to Wady
Halfah, with the exception of the meleks of the Shageea tribe. The
peasants under these chiefs were generally called by the names of
their villages, as those of Dongolah, Dongoloue, Korti, Kortie: but,
since the conquest of the Pasha, they are called Berberene; a name
derived from Berber. Sheakh Muktah[43], the most intelligent Arab
I have ever met with, being, like several in Upper Nubia, of the
race of cadis,—son after son the chief cadi,—and, therefore,
as pure a source of information as by tradition can be obtained,
informed me that all these peasants are of the great tribe of Ababja
from the Yemen, who came here in the reign of the fourth caliph
after Mahomet, and, finding the country inhabited by infidels,
drove some out, but forced the greater number to become Mussulmen;
and that thus the former inhabitants became blended with the Arabs,
and have not been distinguishable from them for ages. This is a
curious and highly interesting tradition, proving, historically,
almost, what might naturally be supposed: but I will say more on
this subject in my Historical Appendix.

The king of Sennaar held a doubtful and precarious rule over this
country, receiving, according to the character of her monarchs,
more or less tribute. The brave Shageea, alone, never bent the knee
to this king. Two hundred years ago, the Sultan of Sennaar, as some
call him, sent here a detachment of the tribe called the Funge,
to which he belonged, to keep this country under his subjection. A
great many of this race are still here, and they are considered
to be inferior only to the Shageea in courage. They are supposed
to be originally a colony of pagans, from the Bahr el Abiad, but
they have nothing of the appearance of negroes. They ruled over the
country 150 years. Ibrahim was the first, and he was succeeded by
his son Musnet: their united reigns lasted eighty years; they sent
considerable quantities of corn, oxen, and horses to Sennaar. The
descendants of Musnet enjoyed less authority over their subjects,
and the tribute to Sennaar was less regularly paid.

In the year 1782 the Shageea overthrew the government of the Funge,
and reigned peaceably in their stead, under three meleks,—Melek
Shouish, Melek Omar, and Melek Zebair. The account Burckhardt gives of
the treacherous conduct of the Mamelukes towards Mahmoud el Adalenab
is very correct, as far as it goes. Hadji Mahmoud Sheakh received them
with every mark of hospitality, ministered to all their wants, and was
in return barbarously murdered at Maraka, this very place which is
now called El Ourde, or The Camp. The following particulars of this
circumstance, which I received from the best sources at Dongolah,
may not be perhaps uninteresting to the reader. The Mamelukes arrived
at Captot; and Sheakh Mahmoud, the chief of the Shageea, descended
the river on the opposite side, with a numerous suite. He bade the
Mamelukes welcome to his kingdom, and informed them that, if they
wished for grain, he would furnish them gratis with any quantity they
desired. He told them, also, that whatever they asked for, which he
possessed, should be immediately sent to their camp; and if they
were anxious, as they professed to be, to proceed up the country
to Sennaar, he would supply them with provisions for the journey,
but if they chose to remain at Captot Marabat, they were welcome.

Four days afterwards, fifteen Mamelukes, or katshefs, as they are
called, rode up and stopped at the door of the house of the grand
Cadi Mahomet, having learnt that the Sheakh Mahmoud was with him. The
sheakh having come out to salute them, they complained that they had
no grain for their horses. The sheakh sent immediately for a bag
for each horse, and ordered his people to fill a boat with grain,
and convey it to the camp. The Mamelukes appeared still dissatisfied,
and would not dismount whilst their horses were feeding. But their
object was soon accomplished; for, as the sheakh approached the horse
of one of them, to arrange the bag of corn it was eating, and said,
“This is sufficient for your horses now, and I will send you as
much as you desire,” the Mameluke, who had his carabine on one side
of his saddle, without putting it to his shoulder, pointed it at
the sheakh, pulled the trigger, and wounded him in the breast. The
sheakh had scarcely drawn his sword a few inches from the scabbard,
when another fired a blunderbuss at him, containing six balls,
and he fell dead: another instantly separated his head from his
body, and they afterwards mangled the corpse in a horrid manner
with their sabres. The Cadi Mahomet, who was with him, was killed
also by a blow of a sabre, and a black slave, who was in attendance,
met a similar fate. Ten of the Shageea peasants, his servants, were
present at this murder, but being unarmed they could not attempt to
revenge the death of their chief, and therefore fled.

The Mamelukes remained nine years masters of the country. Including
the servants, they were about 600 in number. Many died here; the
remainder, on the invasion of the Pasha, went to Shendy, whence
they passed to Darfour, and thence to Bornou, Baghermi, Fezzan,
and Tripoli. Adouram Bey, one of their leaders, was killed near the
latter place; but their other leader, Marfou Bey, arrived in safety
at Tripoli.

I received the greater part of this account from the most authentic
source, Sheakh Muktah, my informant, being the son of the Cadi
Mahomet, who perished with the unfortunate Mahmoud. I ought to
mention, as some palliation of this treacherous breach of hospitality,
that it is said that the Berberene, weary of the Shageea, represented
to the Mamelukes that Sheakh Mahmoud was devising some plan to
destroy them, and therefore they may be said to have murdered him in
self-defence. The object of the Mamelukes was to possess the country;
and they were glad to avail themselves of this feeble excuse to
break the laws of hospitality. Great praise is due to the few who
accomplished the courageous and immense undertaking of crossing the
centre of Africa. Such a journey would immortalise any European,
but who would attempt it? At Darfour, Brown was detained a prisoner;
and in the kingdom of Bornou or Fezzan Hornemann lost his life.

_April_ 16. We left Dongolah at three this afternoon, and, after
three hours’ march, stopped at Mecaurat. Our route has been on
the skirt of the desert, about half a mile from the river. I ought
to acknowledge here the civilities which we received from M. Martin,
a French apothicaire, in the employ of the Pasha, who showed us every
attention in his power, allowing to us a part of his house. I must not
forget, also, the kind attentions of his lady, an Abyssinian girl;
pretty, and, at the same time, kind and affectionate. In return for
a small mirror, which I gave her, she presented me with a Sennaar
dagger, with an ebony handle, ornamented with silver. I keep it as
a remembrance of “la bella Maria.”

_April_ 17. An hour and a half after starting, we arrived at a
government store-house: adjoining it were several cottages in
ruins. After ten hours’ journey, we arrived at Haffeer. The
following is a list of villages and islands between New Dongolah
and the province of El Mahas:—

  Toumbos               Toumbos        Hannek.

In the desert, at a distance, there are isolated hills, apparently
of sandstone. On arriving, we visited the katshef of Haffeer, who
received us very politely; the Mahmoor having spontaneously furnished
me with different letters for the officers in his government: one
for the melek of Argo and the katshef of Solib, &c.

At my request, the katshef immediately ordered a boat to be prepared
to convey us to the Island of Argo, which I was anxious to examine,
not only on account of its great extent, and the antiquities it
contained, but also because it is the only place in Upper Nubia under
the government of its rightful owner, who alone, of all the meleks,
possesses now a shadow of his ancient authority.

_April_ 18. An hour’s sail, with a fair wind, brought us to the
northern extremity of the island, where the village is situated in
which the melek resides. I went to his castle, which is fortified with
towers (see vignette), and protected on one side by a high wall. It is
capable of making some defence against an insurrection of the natives.

[Illustration: FORTIFIED HOUSE OF THE MELEK OF TUMBOL.]

[Illustration]

The court we entered first was filled with slaves of the melek, who,
I was informed, including male and female, amounted to upwards of 200,
living either in or around his residence. I ascended from the court,
by ill-constructed steps, similar to, but not quite so good as,
those we have in England for granaries, and entered into a divan,
or audience-room, which had quite the appearance, and was about the
size, of a small English barn. Around a part of the room was a divan
of earth, besides which there were four angoureebs, or cord divans,
covered with carpets and cushions. The roof is of a slanting form,
resembling that of a barn: the wooden logs of which it is made are
blackened by the smoke of the fires. The beams consist each of two
pieces of timber, which are supported and kept together, at their
junction, by a rough pillar that stands in the centre of the room. To
retain this in its place, and bind it to the beam, there are slips
of wood, about one foot long, on each side of the pillar, under the
beam; and on these the ancient Egyptian and Ethiopian ornament of
the globe and feathers is carved. It is more rudely executed than
the ancient, but still it is curious to find even a vestige of this
ornament in a modern Ethiopian habitation. The doorway, and, indeed,
the house altogether, is rudely constructed, but much stronger and
better than Arab houses in general. The appearance of the outside
is superior to that of the interior.

The melek was out when we arrived. The brick divan already mentioned
was partly occupied by his Arab accountants. In almost every village
there is a little school, or rather, I should say, hut, which is
used as such, and there are few of the peasants who have not made an
attempt to learn to read and write; but, to use their own estimate,
there is not one in a hundred whose knowledge extends beyond the
alphabet, and putting together a few words. There are very few who
can write, and none who know any thing of arithmetic. There are,
however, some few of the sheakhs and others, who, from their learning,
are called fakeers, and who are good Arabic scholars.

When we entered, the melek’s cash-keepers were counting the money
they were receiving from the peasants, and settling their accounts
with the assistance of their strings of beads. In this room, also,
besides the servants, there were several relations, brothers and
nephews, of the melek’s, but not distinguishable by their dress
from the other Arabs.

After we had waited a short time, Melek Tumbol arrived, attended
by about twenty of his people on horseback. The meleks whom I have
hitherto seen have been generally fine tall men, having often an
appearance really noble, and sometimes even majestic. The melek
of Argo, on the contrary, is the most diminutive personage I have
seen in the country: he has a good-tempered countenance, but, on
close examination, something cunning in his expression, and nothing
noble or imposing in his appearance. He was dressed simply as an Arab
sheakh, except that his clothes were of a finer quality. He wore a
long white fine cotton shirt, covering him from the neck to the feet,
with very long and wide sleeves. He had a fine white Souakim shawl,
with the usual red border hanging over his shoulder. His head-dress
consisted of the red cloth cap (tarboush), with one of the silk
Turkish handkerchiefs around it. He received us with the usual Arab
politeness, read the Mahmoor’s letter, and entreated me to make
his house my own. They presented us with coffee and pipes, in the
Turkish fashion, and also with sherbet.

The islands and villages on the eastern side of the Nile are under
his dominion; having belonged, according to his own account, from
time immemorial to his family. He has within his territory, 925
water wheels, besides the land on the banks, which is cultivated
after the inundation, and irrigated by hand labour.

When Ismael Pasha invaded this country, Melek Tumbol immediately
joined his party, and furnished him with provisions for the army. In
consequence of his services on that occasion, the Pasha has allowed
him to remain in the command of his territories, and given to him
the rank and pay of a katshef; and I am told he expects to be made a
mahmoor: he is rich in dromedaries, horses, and slaves, and allowed
to have ten water wheels gratis. His subjects have heavier taxes to
pay than formerly, but they may consider themselves fortunate in not
having inflicted on them the presence of their rulers. Not one Turk
or Arab soldier resides on his territory.

Before the arrival of the melek, I was amused with the conversation
of his servants. They spoke of his generosity as that of the greatest
prince; stating, that, when a peasant gave him a sheep or a goat,
he immediately presented in return a camel or a cow; and they added
numerous similar instances of generosity, which with the Arabs is
the noblest of virtues.

We told the melek that we wished to see the antiquities on his
island. He expressed his willingness to forward our views; but,
as they were four hours distant, and it was then late, he hoped
we would delay our visit until the morning. I was not sorry to be
thus obliged to pass the night with this chief, as I am always glad
of an opportunity of making myself better acquainted with the Arab
customs. There is something so simple and sincere in their hospitality
and manner of living, that, unintellectual as their society is, I
must confess it is not without its charm. The luxurious divan; the
tranquillising pipe; the grateful sherbet and delicious coffee; and
the ease and quiet of Oriental society, are not trifling enjoyments in
this clime, the scorching heat of which alone inclines man to repose.

This is not a country for brilliant conversation and animated
discussion: the former would be too great mental fatigue; and the
warmth and excitement which the latter sometimes occasions, if not
positively fatal, would certainly be extremely prejudicial to health,
when the thermometer is above 100° in the shade. The Turks sit on
their divans, and the Arabs on their angoureebs, and smoke the whole
of the day. There is not the slightest obligation to converse; they
sit and look at each other, and amuse themselves with their pipes,
thoughts, castle-building, or business.

Unless you keep them occupied with your enquiries, long pauses often
occur in the conversation, as if they were reflecting on what you had
said. One advantage of their society is, that the conversation flows
naturally, for not even the host considers any effort necessary to
keep it up. A man in this country is not considered stupid because
he has the sense not to talk nonsense. When any of them tell a tale,
or make an assertion, however improbable they may be, politeness,
aversion to discussion, and perhaps indolence, generally prevent
the others from disputing, or making any remarks upon it. When a
council is held upon subjects of importance, and each person is asked
for his opinion, greater harmony could not exist in any assembly:
the highest in rank expresses his sentiments on the subject first,
and the others almost invariably coincide with him.

If a peasant had enough to support himself and family, even in
a miserable manner, he would never labour to make himself more
comfortable, but spend his time in the enjoyment of idleness, sleeping
and smoking; he would, as the Berbers have been described as doing,
sit for hours together in the shade, in the same position, without
thought or care, with few ideas, and no wish to obtain more.

Their philosophy, however, is remarkable: scarcely an hour of
their lives is embittered with useless regrets. They are totally
free from that anxiety for the morrow which agitates Europeans,
and prevents the enjoyment of the present good, by their insatiable
thirst after greater happiness. An Arab never distresses himself, as
we too often do, with imaginary evils; he is the child of destiny,
and never torments himself with the apprehension of a misfortune
which, if it is really approaching, he believes it out of his
power to prevent. Niebuhr gives an extraordinary instance of their
philosophy.[44]

This temperament is certainly more suitable to the climate, than the
feverish anxiety, the angry passions, and restless ambition, which
drive content from the abodes of so many Europeans. It is true, the
Arabs are ignorant of the high intellectual enjoyments of literary and
scientific pursuits, and of the pleasures, luxuries, and refinements
of polished life; yet few, perhaps, will deny, that the man who is
contented under any circumstances, who immediately becomes resigned to
the caprices of fortune, who scarcely knows the meaning of the words
worldly care, and is unagitated by any regret for past pleasures,
or aching desire to obtain additional enjoyments, is possessed of
a certain degree of practical, and not useless, philosophy.

COLOSSAL STATUE IN THE ISLAND OF ARGO.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

At twelve o’clock dinner was served up; and as the style
was different from any I had hitherto seen, and is that usual
with the kings of this country, a short description may not be
uninteresting. Two mats were laid on the floor, on which we were
invited to seat ourselves: they were rather hard, and not excessively
clean. The dinner was served in six large wooden bowls, and the
bread, which is made into thin light cakes, in elegant baskets of
coloured straw, manufactured in Sennaar. The dinner consisted of
mutton, fowls, bamia (Hibiscus esculentus), and an excellent omelet
in a smaller dish, prepared expressly for myself by the wives of the
melek. Raw onions, which are considered particularly healthy in this
climate, and which, being much milder than ours, are not unpalatable,
particularly after they have been soaked in water, were presented to
each of us. I dined on the omelet, the other dishes being liquid,
and so exceedingly hot, that I burnt my fingers in attempting to
taste them.

The melek sat down with us, but did not eat much; he dines always
in his harem. Of the latter I should say something _en passant_. I
was informed elsewhere that he has had twenty-one, or, as some said,
thirty-two, wives, all daughters or relations of other meleks. He
is said now to have only three. He has no sons, but two beautiful
daughters, unmarried, who, however, already take a share in the
government. My servant saw one of them on an adjoining small island,
where she resides with her slaves, and sends the produce to her
father.

After we had dined, and quitted the mats, my servants and his
cash-keepers sat down; and what they left was cleared by the servants
of the melek. After washing, we had sherbet, coffee, and pipes. The
melek then went to sleep, according to the Arab and Turkish custom. In
the afternoon we walked about the place, and saw the ruins of the
ancient village. The inhabitants of this island suffered severely
from the inroads of the Shageea, with whom they were almost always
at war. The Melek of Argo was able to collect a force of 700 men,
many of them armed with coats of mail, of German manufacture. I
wished to see these; but he said they were all in the possession of
the Pasha of Egypt. This may be true of some of them; but, no doubt,
the greater part he had secreted, aware that the day may arrive when
he may require them.

The present melek has a small plantation of vines and pomegranates,
which flourish luxuriantly in this country. He procured the plants
a few years ago from Egypt; and seems to be prouder of his little
garden than of any thing else he possesses. We had a supper in
the same style as the dinner; and our beds were the angoureebs on
which we had been sitting all the day, with a carpet for a mattress,
and no other covering than our cloaks.

_Island of Argo.—April_ 18. The melek, perceiving my impatience to
visit the antiquities, provided my artist and myself with excellent
horses, while my dragoman, and our guide, his nephew, accompanied us
on dromedaries. We rode through the centre of the island, which is
entirely uncultivated, but planted with acacias, like a shrubbery. The
soil is capable of cultivation; and only a more extensive knowledge
of hydraulics appears required to enable the people to irrigate and
cultivate the whole of the island.

We set out at five o’clock, and, after two hours’ ride (about
ten miles), reached the site of a small town or village, with merely
a few bricks remaining. An hour afterwards we arrived at a similar
place, and in ten minutes more at a third. Twenty minutes from the
latter, being three hours and a half from the time that we started, we
arrived at the antiquities which were the object of our excursion. The
distance, from the rate we travelled, may be about eighteen miles.

COLOSSAL STATUE IN THE ISLAND OF ARGO.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The antiquities amply repaid us for the trouble of visiting
them. They consist chiefly of two colossal statues of grey granite,
now lying on the ground. The faces are Egyptian, but the sculpture is
Ethiopian; not in a very good style, the forms being extremely bulky
and clumsy. The length, including the pedestal, which is 2 feet 10
inches, is 23 feet. One statue has lost part of its arms; the other
is broken into two pieces, but the features are less injured. They
have never been quite finished; which is, doubtless the reason that
neither is ornamented with hieroglyphics. The figures are placed in
the usual standing position of Egyptian statues, one foot advanced
before the other. The one that is broken has on the left foot a small
statue. (See my picturesque views and architectural restoration,
Plates XXXIII., XXXIV., and XXXV.) The ornaments around their necks
and ankles are curious, and quite Ethiopian. The wreath around the
head-dress of one of them is that of a conqueror; which I conceive
to afford a strong ground for conjecturing that these statues were
erected in commemoration of the conquest of Egypt: but I am led to
this conclusion principally from the circumstance of the only name
in hieroglyphics now remaining here being that of Sabaco, the first
king of the Ethiopian dynasty who conquered and reigned over Egypt.

The circumstance of the statues not being finished, may be accounted
for by the brief duration, at that period, of the Ethiopian dominion
over this part of the country. The statues erected to celebrate the
triumph of their arms in Egypt would naturally be thrown down by the
Egyptian invaders. Psammitichus, the first king of the 26th dynasty,
who reigned immediately after the Ethiopians, and whose territory,
we know, from the Greek inscription at Abou Simbel, certainly
extended as far as the second cataract, might have conquered this
part of Ethiopia, and thrown down the statues of a king naturally
so hateful to the Egyptians. They seem, like the two celebrated
statues at Thebes, to have ornamented the entrance of a temple,
for behind them is a considerable space covered with sandstone,
all in small pieces, but evidently the ruins of a large temple.

Forty paces behind these colossals is a beautiful fragment of a small
seated statue, without a head, and half buried in the ruins: the name
of Sabaco is engraved on it in hieroglyphics; and 43 paces behind
the latter is a group of six small monkeys, very much mutilated,
and almost buried in the ground. The ruins of the temple extend 20
paces farther. It may have been perhaps from 250 to 300 feet long;
but, profiting by the softness of the sandstone, the stones seem to
have been studiously broken into the smallest fragments. There are,
unfortunately, no hieroglyphics, except the name of Sabaco, before
mentioned, remaining either on the statues or any of the stones; and,
from the degree in which the edifice is destroyed, I did not conceive
that, at all events, much advantage would be derived from excavation.

The name of this town is unknown; and, though the temple appears to
have been considerable, the remains afford no ground to suppose that
the place was of great importance. There is every reason to believe,
however, that the Island of Argo was formerly much more flourishing
than now. The different remains of ancient towns in the interior,
now surrounded merely with acacia groves and uncultivated plains,
prove the cultivation, at that time, to have been much more extended,
and the island to have contained not only better built cities,
but also a civilised population acquainted with the arts.

A sheakh, from a village at a short distance from the ruins, sent
us some excellent bread and milk; and, when our work was finished,
we went to his house, and reposed on his angoureebs,—luxuries which
every peasant possesses: we also partook of some dates, bouza, and
palm wine; the latter is like the honey of dates only more diluted
with water. Strabo speaks of the Ethiopian beverage made of honey
and barley; and also adds, that the only fruit in that country
are a few dates in the royal gardens. After requiting the sheakh
for his attention, we returned by the bank of the river to Melek
Tumbol’s house.

[Illustration: Pl. 35.

RESTORATION OF THE TWO COLOSSAL STATUES IN THE ISLAND OF ARGO.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The country was rich and beautiful, and I observed a great quantity
of indigo. In the melek’s territory, there are 500 water-wheels
employed in the cultivation of this plant. It requires much water,
each wheel being sufficient to irrigate on an average only three
quarters of a feddan of land.

_April_ 19. We dined and slept last night with the melek, and left
him this morning soon after sunrise. We gave a backsheesh (present)
of money to his servants, and, in return for his attention, I gave
him the amber mouth-piece of my pipe. We returned in his boat to
Haffeer; but as it was navigated by only two mariners, and sailed
ill, I there procured another from the katshef to visit the granite
quarries near the village of Toumbos.

On the east side, almost directly opposite to Haffeer, there is
a brick ruin, half an hour’s walk from the river. I perceived,
at a distance, that it was of no importance; but recollecting
that Cailliaud mentioned it in his work as resembling the towers
represented in the sculptures at Thebes, I visited it on foot, for
want of any conveyance, and suffered severely from the scorching,
almost vertical, mid-day sun. The ruin being situated in the
desert, my feet, unprotected with stockings, which I have long since
discarded, were dreadfully burnt by the hot soft sand, in which we
sank, at every step, considerably above the shoes. This ruin has not
the slightest resemblance to the towers in the sculpture at Thebes. It
has been apparently for ages so much decayed, as scarcely to present
any other form than that of a mere mass of brickwork; but I conceive
it to be Ethiopian, and very ancient. It is difficult to imagine
what has been its exact form (see vignette); but it has evidently not
resembled, in any respect, the elegant fortresses represented on the
walls of Thebes. The entrance into it, as will be seen by the view,
is partly remaining. The name of the village near it is Korma.

[Illustration: RUIN OF AN ETHIOPIAN FORT.]

We were two hours in descending the river to Toumbos. Immediately
before arriving, we passed the first of the cataracts of Hennek. The
country (see vignette) is very pleasing, flat, not romantic or
picturesque, like the scenery between Philæ and Assuan; but the
luxuriance of the vegetation on the islands, the acacias in the
foreground, the picturesque groups of palm trees, the masses of
rock impeding the current, and varying the tint of the river by the
white surges they create, and, in the distance, the yellow sands,
formed altogether a soft and lovely landscape. The rocks of the
third cataract, at least here, are of grey granite.

A very short distance from the river, on a granite rock, called
Hadjer el Dehab, or the Golden Stone, is a large historical tablet
of hieroglyphics, with the common Egyptian ornament above it, of the
globe, serpents, and wings. The hieroglyphics have been well executed,
but are now so defaced that few of them are distinguishable. I
copied a small portion of it containing the name of Thothmes I.;
and in another small tablet adjoining, I observed the prænomen of
Amunoph III.

[Illustration: CATARACT OF HENNEK.]

From the similarity of this granite, I think it evident that the
statues of Argo have been taken from these quarries. There is here
also another statue, twelve feet in length, much injured, but in
a tolerably good style of sculpture (see vignette, page 218). The
head has been destroyed, perhaps by some accident in separating it
from the rock, or rather in conveying it to its destination.

The katshef of Haffeer, through some misunderstanding, I suppose,
had informed me that Toumbos was distant only half an hour’s or
an hour’s sail. We, therefore, brought with us neither provisions,
beds, nor coverings. On arriving at Toumbos, the sheakh invited us to
pass the night with him. By the time we had finished our drawings
and examination of the quarries, it was almost night, and, the
wind having subsided, it was impossible to cross the cataract. We,
therefore, gladly accepted his hospitality, having had nothing to
eat since morning but grain, heated a little over the fire, with
salt. The Arabs are fond of grain prepared in this manner; and,
mixed with a few dates, it is not disagreeable.

The sheakh first conducted us into a ruined house, now used as a
mosque, rather miserable-looking, close to the river, and therefore
cold, especially for us, who had no covering. The heat of the day
being so excessive, the fresh air of the night, and particularly
of the morning, feels extremely chill. I complained of this
accommodation, at which he seemed vexed, and asked my servant if we
wished to sleep in his harem. Our complaint, however, procured us
a comfortable room in his own house, good angoureebs, covered with
mats and skins to lie on, a cheerful wood fire, and a good supper of
excellent bread and milk, with a large bowl of meat. We had therefore
no reason to complain of the sheakh’s hospitality.

[Illustration: COLOSSAL STATUE IN THE QUARRIES OF TOUMBOS.]

_April_ 20. At sunrise, after remunerating the sheakh for his
attentions with a present of money, which I conceived would be
the most acceptable that could be offered, we profited by a slight
breeze, and, with the assistance of three of the peasants, passed the
cataract. The sheakh gave me the not uncommon salutation at parting
of “Minsh Allah rasak taip!”—“May God preserve your head
from harm!” in a tone which appeared to me curious at the time,
but which, I conceived, might allude to the passing of the cataract;
though, as will soon be seen, before the setting of the sun, I
understood his meaning. Soon afterwards, being becalmed, we pressed
into our service a dozen peasants, who dragged us along with a cord.

This morning, and also yesterday, we saw on an island of sand,
near Haffeer, a large hippopotamus. This is the only one that now
remains in this part of the river, or so far to the northward. Here,
too, it is said that this animal flies from the approach of man,
and even from the boats. Each time that we approached the isle,
it darted into the water. There were, a short time ago, several in
this part of the river; but Melek Tumbol told me that he and his
people had destroyed all of them, with the exception of this one,
which had always eluded their pursuit. We did not arrive at Haffeer
until one in the afternoon, half-famished, having had nothing for
breakfast but a small handful of grain.

We received intelligence there which threw us into the greatest
consternation. The province of Mahas, which commences at Hannek,
one hour’s journey north from this place, and extends as far as
Sukkot, has broken out into insurrection. The dreadful consequences
of this event, cutting off completely my return to Egypt and Europe,
and making me a prisoner Heaven knows how long; also the uncertainty
of how widely the flame may spread, and what may be the result,
caused me the greatest anxiety. I am informed there are already 300
insurgents collected, and that their number increases hourly.

The reason ascribed for this revolt is, that the government refused
to accept in part payment of their taxes the linen cloths made in
the country. The owners of each water-wheel, besides grain to the
amount of five dollars, pay also fifteen in cash: the difficulty of
realising this sum may be easily conceived in a country where there
are no markets, little or no commerce, and that generally carried on
by exchange. The katshef of Haffeer, on hearing, this morning, that
they had murdered a kaimacam (officer), and three soldiers, within
two hours’ march of his residence, hastened to the spot with about
thirty soldiers, being all the forces he could muster. The insurgents
had retired upon an island. He buried the three men the Mahas had
killed, and brought away the other, whom they had severely wounded
in various places, and left as dead. The katshef informed me, that,
as he could not desert his post, he intended to shut himself up in
the indigo manufactory, which was partly fortified. I immediately
ordered my camels to be loaded for our return to Ourde, or New
Dongolah, for it is now impossible to proceed on our journey north.

That dress which has hitherto been our protection, and procured
us every where respect, now makes us a mark for the attack of the
insurgents. They would never suppose that any friend of theirs
would wear the costume of their oppressors. In our nizam dresses
we should certainly be taken for Turks, and perhaps murdered in a
summary manner. We have every reason to thank Providence that we
were detained a day at Argo, otherwise our fate was inevitable,
for we should have been exactly in the centre of the revolt at the
very moment when it broke out. In these countries, where Europeans
are almost unknown, except the few who, being in the service of the
Pasha, are considered as Turks, the natives only distinguish two
classes,—their own countrymen, and the white men, their tyrants
and oppressors. We could not have expected to be spared, even had
they recognised us as travellers: for they would have murdered us
for the treasures which they imagine we find among the ruins.

It were endless to enumerate the ridiculous stories which the Arabs
relate of these fancied discoveries. I will, however, mention one or
two, as characteristic. On our return from the colossal statues in the
Island of Argo, to the house of Melek Tumbol, one of his cash-keepers
asked me if we had found any gold; and he stated as a fact to a crowd
of Arabs in the room (swearing by his beard and the prophet), that
at a ruin called Dendera, in Egypt, he accompanied two Englishmen,
who obtained an immense treasure. The devil refused it until they
should give him a water melon, to allay his thirst. The Englishman
then sent him all the way to Kennah for the melon, and that as soon
as the devil smelt the fine odour of the fruit, gold came down like
rain. This the man declared he had seen with his own eyes, and all
the Arabs implicitly believed him.

At Gibel el Birkel, the natives conceived that my excavations
were made only to find gold; and they supposed me less fortunate,
or less clever, than the last European, a noble Lord, who visited
those ruins, who was stated to have found such a quantity, in the
form of a granite lion, that he was obliged to have a boat from
Dongolah to carry it down to Egypt.

_El Ourde, or New Dongolah.—April_ 21. Immediately on my
arrival, I paid a visit to the governor, but was not received;
for, notwithstanding the general alarm which exists on account of
the insurrection, he could not deny himself his mid-day nap. In the
evening I was more successful. The more I see of this man, the more
I feel alarmed about the length of time I may be detained, and what
may be the result of this unfortunate affair, for I perceive clearly
he is incapable of taking any resolution. He complained of not having
force sufficient. I advised him to adopt the common Turkish system
of offering a general pardon and lighter taxes, or muster all his
forces, and crush, at once, a movement which, in a country like this,
was likely to spread so rapidly.

_April_ 29. A week passed without any plan being determined upon. I
had not chosen to renew my advice, perceiving what I had already
given to be fruitless. The greatest panic existed in the town. Some
proposed to fly up the country; others, to reach Egypt by crossing the
desert by Selemeh. We had, every day, some new and false rumour, that
other districts had revolted, and that the whole valley of the Nile,
from Wady Halfah to the extremity of the Pasha’s dominions, was on
the point of throwing off the yoke of their oppressors. Sometimes
the insurgents were reported to be within an hour’s march of the
town, preparing to attack it. Muskets were distributed, the cannons
prepared, and we were all to fight for our lives. At length, the
officers, who are a despicable set, became refractory: some refused to
march, while others were anxious to commence operations. The governor
was undecided; some officers of the divan advised one course, and some
another; and, while he vacillated between them, day passed after day,
without any plan being adopted.

Foreseeing the consequences of this irresolution, while discontent
was spreading even among the government troops, and the insurgents
daily increasing, I determined to make one effort more to rouse him
from his lethargy, and persuade him to adopt some vigorous measure. I,
therefore, visited him, accompanied by a Greek dragoman, with whom the
governor, being a Turk from the Morea, could converse in the Romaic
without any other person in the divan understanding our discourse. I
thus obtained the best chance of my advice being followed, by sparing
his _amour propre_, of which he had a considerable stock.

I apologised for the liberty I was taking; conscious that, as a
stranger, I had no right to interfere with his administration; but
that my fate was linked with his, as the success of my own plans
depended on his being able to restore order and tranquillity to
the country. In return, too, for his attentions, I was anxious,
if possible, to be of service to him; I regretted his present
difficult situation, particularly as I saw him surrounded by men
guided more by their passions than by reason. To my surprise,
he raised up his head, which generally hangs over his knees,
almost touching them, and expressed his willingness to listen to,
and follow, my counsel. Tormented as he has been, for several days,
with the insolent dictation of his officers, each insisting on some
wild scheme of his own, he turned a ready ear to my suggestions,
which were, of course, disinterested. Each officer, on the contrary,
hoped, if his plan should be adopted, and be successful, that he
might have the merit of the victory, and obtain, in consequence,
a present from the Pasha.

I urged the governor to send to some of the sheakhs up the Nile,
who are strongly attached to the government, and have no affection
for the Mahas, to assemble their forces; and also to Melek Tumbol,
who is said to have a force of 500 men, while the former could muster
600 men, and both would be quite willing to join the government. The
governor had imprudently ordered the soldiers scattered in the
different villages to assemble, under the katshefs and kaimacams,
in bands of fifty. This had caused great dissatisfaction, by showing
that he distrusted the fidelity of the peasants; and the measure
was useless, except in affording a security for the lives of the
soldiers, which, after all, was only apparent; for bands of fifty
were too small to keep extensive districts in subjection, or protect
themselves against the united attacks of the peasantry. I urged
the governor to send for these troops to replace the garrison here,
which he might thus be enabled to send out against the revolters. He
consented to this proposition very reluctantly.

To my surprise, he informed me that he had sent no courier to
Cairo. He had despatched one to Khartoun, in the hopes of procuring
a reinforcement from that district. I did not think it probable
that the government there would risk its security by sending part of
their force to Dongolah: but it was great neglect not to inform all
the governors around of the revolt, that they might guard against any
attempts within their own territories; particularly as it is rumoured,
though, probably, without foundation, that this is only the first
explosion of a grand conspiracy, formed by the people, throughout
Upper Nubia, to avail themselves of the present opportunity, whilst
the Pasha is engaged with the war in Syria, to throw off his yoke.

The number of soldiers here at present is 200, part of a regiment
of invalids sent to this province, being of no use at Cairo; the
remainder of the regiment is scattered, as I have said, in small
parties, about the province. As the Arab and Turkish merchants in
the bazaar are more than sufficient to protect the citadel, and their
fidelity may be relied upon, their lives and property being at stake,
I urged the governor to send off the troops in the garrison without
delay; and he promised that he would do so as soon as the necessary
arrangements could be made. I advised him also to mount guards on
the citadel, to dispel the panic which existed, and prevent the
possibility of the place being surprised.

_April_ 30. The katshef of Haffeer arrived, without having received
permission from the governor to abandon his post, but conceiving it
impossible, with only 50 men, to protect the indigo house, which
is but partially fortified, against the threatened attack of the
insurgents. He stated the force of the latter to be 1500 men; and a
courier arrived last night, with the intelligence, that yesterday more
soldiers were killed, and that another party of fifty only escaped
through the means of an Arab sheakh, abandoning their baggage, and,
_mirabile dictu_ for Turks, also their pipes!

_May_ 1. The troops, 150 in number (leaving 50 in the citadel),
marched out this morning against the Mahas. They were accompanied
by 120 volunteers, some of them mounted. The Hassanyeh and Funge,
500 strong, and Melek Tumbol on the opposite bank, with 500 more,
are waiting to join them. They took with them one piece of cannon, an
eight-pounder, on which they rested their chief hopes of success. The
review of these warriors caused a great sensation in this little
capital. The governor had distributed muskets and ammunition to
all the merchants who joined the expedition, and also to those who
remained in garrison. Each man was trying his weapon by firing
it off. The women were weeping, and demonstrating their grief,
according to the custom of the country, by a peculiar _lululoo_,
caused by drawing their breath, and shaking their tongues between
their lips, at the same time waving their hands, in sign of wishes
for their husbands’ success.

Considering how this expedition was composed, I was almost doubtful
of its success. The soldiers and officers were the refuse of the
Pasha’s army; the merchants a confused mass; the commander notorious
for cowardice; the cannon in the hands of men not renowned for their
skill in engineering; and it seemed doubtful whether friendship to the
Turks, the rancour of ancient feuds, or even the hope of plunder, be
sufficient motives to induce the Hassanyeh Arabs and Melek Tumbol’s
forces to act against their neighbours, fighting for their liberty,
to free themselves from a grievous and intolerable yoke, and who
had placed their all upon the die,—death or victory. The governor
himself reviewed the troops outside the walls, and gave his last
directions. How ridiculous this expedition would have appeared in
Europe! It reminded me of the army of Bombastes Furioso; and the
Mahmoor might have dismissed them with the same words,—


  “Begone, brave soldiers, don’t kick up a row!”


_May_ 2 and 3. were spent in great anxiety about the result of the
expedition. Rumours were spread that the government troops were
defeated, and that the Mahas were coming to attack the citadel.

_May_ 4. This morning news arrived of the engagement, and that
the Pasha’s troops had gained the victory. On the 10th, they and
the merchants returned, and I received from some sensible Turkish
merchants, on whose authority I could depend, the following account
of the battle. The insurgents, 1300 strong, at three o’clock in
the afternoon advanced to attack the government forces, encamped a
little below Hannek. Their chief, Melek Backeet, sent round 300 of
his men to intercept the enemy’s retreat; for it never occurred to
the brave warriors of Mahas that they could possibly be defeated. If
they had possessed any degree of judgment, or been less confident,
and had made the attack during the night, they would probably have
succeeded; for at that time no sentinels or guards were established,
and the greatest confusion reigned in the Turkish camp.

About 150 of the Mahas had guns, but very bad ones, mostly matchlocks,
and they were very ill supplied with ammunition. They were variously
armed; some with lances, shields, German swords (see various plates of
costumes); while others had only swords made of the acacia wood, about
four feet long, rounded at one end for the hand, the rest cut thin,
flat, and sharpened at both sides,—a heavy but formidable weapon in
the hands of an athletic Arab. Others had staves only. Sentences in
Arabic were written by the fakeers, on the wooden swords and staves;
on some of them lines from the Koran: the most common were,—“May
God give me force to destroy my enemies!” “May my foes tremble
before me!” “May the acacia sword be as the sharp steel in
my hand!” I have seen a staff similarly shaped in the museum at
Berlin, with hieroglyphics on it; the latter I could not examine,
as it was on a shelf, at too great a distance to be read.

Twelve Turks on horseback accompanied the troops; to whom, with
the Arab merchants (Jelabs), and about 500 Hassanyeh, must be
ascribed the honour of the victory. Melek Tumbol’s Arabs were on
the opposite side of the river, and the soldiers of the government
were so placed by their skilful commander, behind their own friends,
that they could not fire a single shot. The general, usually a great
talker, became miraculously silent when the engagement commenced;
and, knowing the value of his person, very prudently placed it out
of danger. The artillerymen fired the cannon sixty-two times, only
wounding one man: but, to give them their due, I was informed by
several, that the victory was chiefly gained by the noise they made.

To the astonishment of the brave Mahas, the government forces, or
rather the merchants, undeterred by their cries of “Cip! cap!”
and dancing round and round (see view of the Shageea fighting,
Plate XXXVIII.), returned the shaking of their spears with a good
discharge of musketry, while the Hassanyeh made a sharp attack. An
engagement of a few minutes ended in the unfortunate Mahas flying
to the river. Numbers were shot sitting on the rocks and islands,
and others in crossing the stream: altogether about 120 perished.

The regular troops, not having fired a ball during the engagement,
discharged their muskets in the air to celebrate _their_ victory;
and the brave commander, now quite loquacious, gratified his thirst
for blood by the massacre of two unfortunate young prisoners,
who fell into his hands. Melek Backeet, the chief of the Mahas,
is said to be concealed in the country, but that feudal attachment
to their chief, which is so strong among all the Arabs, will secure
him against being discovered.

A general pardon having been proclaimed, according to the usual
Turkish system, until the government feels itself sufficiently
strong to punish the delinquents, several of the inferior sheaks have
accepted the amnesty offered by the governor, and the peasants are
returning to their occupations. Many of the water-wheels are injured,
and a great number of the working oxen killed by the Mahas. The loss
to the government cannot, it is said, be less than 5000_l._

My chief apprehension now is, that the roads will be infested by
the most desperate of the Mahas, acting as brigands; among others,
by their chief: we are therefore still detained here until this man
is taken, or has left the country, and tranquillity is entirely
restored. Several caravans of merchants are likewise deterred
from going down to Egypt. They thus incur a large expense, having
to maintain a number of slaves; but they seem greatly afraid of
encountering the journey. I proposed forming a great caravan, but
they coolly replied, that they should wait until the full moon, and,
in the mean time, see whether I passed safely.

_May_ 11. The return of the expedition was celebrated with great
rejoicings. The Mahmoor, shortly after sunrise, reviewed about 300
troops, who have arrived, within these few days, from Handek, Meroueh,
and other parts of the province; he marched out with these, and
joined the armament encamped at a short distance from the walls, and
all together then entered the citadel, in procession. The governor,
at the head of the regular troops, who kept up a continual fire,
went foremost, followed by the Turks and sheakhs on horseback,
going through their evolutions, which consisted in a kind of mock
battle, where they certainly displayed admirable horsemanship;
sometimes galloping at full speed, suddenly halting, and wheeling
round and round, the Turks firing their pistols, and the sheakhs
brandishing their lances. Some of the meleks and sheakhs made a very
picturesque appearance, being well mounted, with their peculiar
costumes, lances, swords, and shields, the latter of the hide of
the hippopotamus. After these came the Jelabs, or merchants of the
bazaar, making liberal use of the muskets and ammunition given to
them by the governor. Then followed a great number of the Hassanyeh,
and some few of the Shageea Arabs, mounted on camels, dromedaries,
or horses, and some on foot, going through their evolutions as in
battle, brandishing their spears, leaping in the air, first on one
leg, then on the other, at the same time turning round and shouting
their war cry, “Cip! cap!” and beating their shields with their
spears. Lastly came a tribe, formerly mentioned, the Funge,—fine
athletic men, said to be very brave. They wear, like the others,
their garments in the antique style, and their heads, as is the
custom of the Arabs of the desert, uncovered, but protected from
the sun by bushy tresses, reaching almost to the shoulders.

The _coup-d’œil_ was rendered particularly striking, by the
variety of costumes, complexions, and arms, and the singularity
of the evolutions. We saw in one field the regular troops, Fellahs
from Egypt, marching and firing in the European manner; the natives
of the Caucasus, the Turks, exhibiting their more dashing Mameluke
exercise; but neither of them attracted half so much my attention
as the wild extraordinary manœuvres of the dark peasants of the
country and the Arabs of the desert. I should not forget, also, the
cries of the women. The house-tops, and the walls of the citadel,
were covered with them, cackling (I think that the most appropriate
term) a welcome to their husbands in the same curious manner I
have before described; but on this occasion the note was different,
being expressive of joy at their return.

The governor, afraid of the Pasha’s censuring, and, perhaps,
dismissing him, on account of this affair, pays, from his own purse,
the expense of the expedition; and he has made a present of 100
piastres to each Turk, 50 to each melek, 30 to each sheakh, of 10
to each peasant and merchant. He pays for the gunpowder also,—no
trifle, since, beside what was consumed in the action, they have been
firing ever since, to indulge their fondness for the report of a gun,
under the plea of celebrating the governor’s triumph. The day is to
be devoted to feasting and rejoicing. Those who can afford it have
killed cows, others sheep. The mallums, the Coptic treasurers and
writers of the government, are now very conspicuously exhibiting
their joy. They have been terribly alarmed during this affair;
conceiving, perhaps with some reason, that, besides their office,
and having the character of being individually rich, their obnoxious
titles of Christian dogs and tax-gatherers would have ensured to them,
had the citadel been taken, being the first to have their throats cut.

In relating the causes of this insurrection, I shall only be giving
a sketch of the Turkish system of governing the provinces, which has
rarely, if ever, been sufficiently elucidated. The government of the
pashas in Egypt is essentially military. The officers all of whom
(except sometimes the baractars) are Turks, decide every question
connected with the revenues, and often interfere, in other affairs,
with the decisions of the cadis. The system of the government is to
extort from the peasant the utmost possible amount of tax, leaving
him only what they consider, or pretend to consider, a sufficient
subsistence, but it is usually a most miserable one.

I will give a more detailed account of the system in Egypt, at a
future opportunity, and shall here only say a few words respecting
that unfortunate country. If the peasants did not actually steal from
their own fields, in some places, they could not exist. Although
they bury their grain under ground, and by various other methods
deceive their oppressors, numbers perish from the want of sufficient
nourishment and clothing. I have seen them, in winter, assembled in
a corner, round a miserable fire, shivering with cold and hunger. In
the most favoured clime under heaven, and the most productive country
on the face of the earth, a vast proportion of the peasants may be
said barely to exist upon food more calculated for cattle than for
human beings, and, bad as it is, they have rarely enough.

The Pasha has power sufficient to hold them in subjection, and by his
extortions fills his coffers; but necessity alone induces them to
submit. He not only imposes most enormous taxes upon every article
of produce, but obliges them to cultivate what he chooses, and take
the price he offers for the produce. He is the only purchaser of
the grain, cotton, and indigo, and of the gum of Kordofan, ostrich
feathers, and other articles. Slaves are almost the only commodity
the merchants now are allowed to take in exchange for the manufactures
they carry to Sennaar and Kordofan: even wild animals of the desert,
as the giraffe, are a monopoly of the government.

The Pasha is the great landlord of this immense district: the people
are his slaves. His revenues are derived not only from the regular
taxes, but from his profits as a merchant, which are enormous,
in consequence of the low rate at which he pays the peasants for
their produce, compared with that at which he sells it again to
the Europeans. It is true that this source of gain is greatly
diminished by the roguery of the different officers through whose
hands it passes. From the highest to the lowest there is seldom any
exception,—mahmoors, nazrs, katshefs, kaimacams, and soldiers, all
concur in diminishing the amount, and, in particular, the mallums,
or Coptic accountants. The latter not only cheat the ignorant Turks,
who generally cannot read their accounts, but often trade with the
money of the treasury, and incur losses which they are unable to
repay. A number, on this account, are always immured in the prisons
of the Pasha.

The peasants in Upper Nubia are free from these pecuniary distresses,
and are comparatively happy. It is very true, that, instead of paying
only one dollar in money, two pieces of linen cloth, and a sheep,
thirty piastres, which was all they paid their ancient meleks, they
are now obliged to pay fifteen dollars in cash, and five in grain;
in all, three hundred piastres: ten times as much as they paid
formerly. Instead of sleeping, as was their custom, the greater part
of the day, they are now obliged to work: but the man who is at all
industrious may earn an ample sufficiency to afford food and dress
such as he has been accustomed to. The following calculation will
show more precisely their present condition.

Each sakkea, or Persian wheel, is sufficient to water three quarters
of a feddan of land, planted with indigo, and each feddan produces
a hundred cantars of the herb, and sometimes more, when carefully
irrigated: being seventy-five cantars for the extent of land which
one wheel will water. The government pay the peasants 12½ Egyptian
piastres for each quintal; that is, 937 piastres for the whole,
which, at the current rate of the dollar here, 15 piastres, is equal
to 62½ dollars; whence we must deduct twenty for the duty, and there
remains for the persons to whom the wheel belongs, 42½ dollars, or
637 piastres: but, as this is the lowest calculation, we may fairly
estimate nearly two piastres per day for each water-wheel. This will
go to the support of one family, provided it can afford five persons
capable of putting their shoulders to the wheel; but otherwise, two
families must unite to reckon up that number. A great deduction on
the gain of the peasant in Egypt is the immense expense of the wheel:
but here they are so much more simple, they cost a very trifling sum;
the oxen only 30 piastres each, and their keep next to nothing.

However small a sum two piastres, or sevenpence English, may appear
to a European, it is amply sufficient in this climate, where every
necessary is so cheap. In Lower and Upper Egypt, where bread is so
much dearer, and meat and milk double the price, the fixed price of
a labourer amounts to half a piastre per day, to sustain himself
and perhaps a family. Most of the peasants here, too, have other
slips of land which are watered by the inundation of the river, and
they gain considerably by their date trees, notwithstanding that
they pay a tax of a piastre for each tree. They also rear flocks,
and cultivate vegetables, particularly the favourite Arab ones,
bamia and malakkhia; they make linen, spirit, bouza, &c. They allow,
too, that grain pays them still better than indigo.

The condition of the peasants of Upper Nubia is thus happy, compared
to those of Egypt. In this country, you very rarely see a peasant
with a ragged garment, and there are very few of the men who have
not their harems. Those who live near the seat of government have
also the advantage of supplying the markets with the few vegetables
the country produces, and of being employed as workmen. Some also
keep camels, which afford them a large profit.

The Arabs of the desert have still more reason to be satisfied
with the present government, so far as regards their pecuniary
interests. They pay tribute only for the land they cultivate,
which is in general very little, and in many cases none at all;
but otherwise they gain a sufficient livelihood, by transporting
to Egypt, with their camels, the grain collected as revenue, or
purchased by the government, and in aiding the now constant passage
of troops and merchants. Many of the Arab tribes of Kordofan, who
formerly never came here, now participate in the profit of carrying
the 2500 camel loads of gum, which, as before stated, are annually
sent from that country to Cairo.

Thus the labouring peasants of the Nile and the Arabs of the desert
in Upper Nubia, so far as regards the taxes and means of subsistence,
are in happy circumstances compared to the Fellaheen of Egypt; but in
other respects they are equally galled by their Turkish rulers. In
Egypt, the officers only are oppressive: the soldiers, who are
Fellaheen, like the peasants, are not so insolent as here, where
their comparatively white complexion, their character as conquerors,
and their pride as _askari_, or soldiers, induce them to despise
the natives, and oppress them more than the government authorises.

When the chief governor of a province is possessed of talent,
energy, and firmness, the officers and soldiers are prevented from
committing many excesses; but when the country has the misfortune
to be under a man like the Mahmoor of Dongolah,—too timid to
redress the complaints continually made against the disorderly
soldiers,—its state may easily be imagined. Each soldier is a
little tyrant, and commits a series of gross and petty vexations
inconceivable to a European. Of the many I have witnessed, I will
give only a few specimens:—If the soldier wants a sheep, fowls,
eggs, or any other article, he obliges the peasant to sell them at
half the market price, and not unfrequently refuses to pay any thing
at all. When becalmed on the river, he goes on shore, and forces
ten, and sometimes twenty, natives to drag his boat, without any
remuneration. If he meets a peasant girl carrying milk or butter,
he often helps himself to half without paying for it, unless with a
salute; and woe betide the imprudent sheahk or peasant who refuses to
give gratuitously the best his house affords, or neglects the horse
or camel of the Turk or soldier who has taken up his quarters for the
night at his house. If camels or donkeys are wanted, they must furnish
them, and consider themselves fortunate if they get any trifle in
return. The haughty manner of the conquerors is still more galling
to the Arabs: their usual manner of addressing them is, “_Kelp,
Marhas!_”—“Dog! villain! Do this! do that! quick! quick! cursed
be your race!” with threats of a beating, even actual blows, and
sometimes with the sole of the shoe, which is the greatest indignity
that a Mahometan can receive.

Men whose ancestors have been chiefs in the country for ages must
now submit to the insolence and contumely of this vile and lawless
soldiery. From negligence the latter often do not demand the tax
on the water-wheels for some time; then, all at once, they appear,
calling out, “Pay me to-morrow, or the bastinado!” The peasant,
not being allowed sufficient time to raise the money, is obliged to
suffer this degrading punishment, and often even have his ears nailed
to a board. Being at a distance, perhaps, from the seat of government,
or large market towns, he has no opportunity of selling his produce;
nevertheless, with double the value of the sum required in effects,
he has to undergo a disgraceful punishment, because he has no dollars.

The Mahas who revolted had not paid the government for some
time. The mahmoor sent a villanous Turk into their province, with
the instruments of torture, who immediately began bastinadoing them,
nailing their ears, and threatening to cut off their heads, if they
did not pay him. He visited Melek Backeet, who owed a considerable
sum to the government, and told him that, if he did not pay his
taxes in a few days, every species of torture would be inflicted upon
him. The Mahas manufacture a strong linen cloth, which is very much
esteemed throughout all the valley of the Nile. Being at a distance
from the capital, and thus unable to command an immediate sale, at
least for the large quantity on hand, they tendered it in part of
their taxes. The government refused, though the transaction would
have been very advantageous to them, the linen being offered at a
price much lower than it sells for in the bazaar of Dongolah. Melek
Backeet, therefore, excited the revolt, preferring death to the
ignominious punishment with which he was threatened.

This country, under proper management, might become a far greater
source of wealth to the Pasha than it even now is. Notwithstanding
the galling system of the Turks, the natives are sensible of the
advantages of a settled and firm government; and the peasants of the
Nile, most particularly, are glad to be released from the tyranny
and spoliation accompanying the feuds and petty wars by which the
country was formerly torn. Did the Turks but treat them as men, and
not disgust them by their insulting manners, and by inflicting on
them such degrading and infamous punishments; had their rulers but
a few ideas of common policy and legislation, the resources might
be greatly augmented, the revenue increased, and the people would
be the most happy and contented under the sun. The superiority which
fire-arms afforded to their haughty conquerors taught them to despise
the strength of the Arabs, and, with that insolence which is ever
united with ignorance, they do not in the slightest degree endeavour
to attach them to the government, or, in fact, condescend to treat,
otherwise than as a vastly inferior race, the people which it cost
them so much, even with all their advantages, to conquer.

_May_ 18. I conceived, from the information which I obtained from the
government, and other quarters, that I might now pass with tolerable
safety through the province of Mahas, particularly by not following
the banks of the river, but taking the short cut across the Desert,
from Fakeer el Bint to Solib. By this route I shall miss the ruin
of Sescé; but, as it consists only of two or three columns, I
shall consider myself fortunate if I escape from the country with
this slight sacrifice. My caravan wish me to go on direct to Egypt,
without stopping at any more ruins, particularly those of the splendid
and celebrated Temple of Solib, which is situated at the northern
extremity of Mahas; but I have told them that I will not leave that
place until I have fully examined it, and taken every drawing and
measurement I shall consider necessary. They are dreadfully afraid
of meeting with Melek Backeet, who, with a few desperate companions,
has committed several depredations: they think it very hard to incur
any risk for the sake of a few old stones: but I have hazarded my
own life and health in visiting this baneful clime; and I will not
consent to pass, in that hurried manner, one of the chief objects
of my journey. I took leave of the mahmoor, who gave me a guard,
consisting of an Arab baractar (ensign) and six soldiers, mounted
on dromedaries. We have, therefore, now nothing to apprehend from
stragglers. None of the merchants would venture to join my caravan,
notwithstanding my having a guard. I should delay my departure
for some days, but I see no chance of Melek Backeet being taken,
and, consequently, of the roads being clear, and I am sick of this
detention. We left Dongolah at three o’clock, and slept in a
beautiful grove of palm trees.

_May_ 19. Arrived this evening at Haffeer, and was well entertained
by the katshef, who chose the finest sheep in the village to regale
my caravan.

_Hannek.—May_ 20. We started soon after sunrise. Two Turkish
officers, with their servants, joined my caravan this morning. Their
company was not desirable, but the addition to our force, of six
persons, well armed, was not to be despised. We halted at Hannek, to
fill our water-skins, previous to entering the desert. After dinner,
at three P.M., we were on the point of mounting our dromedaries, when
a courier arrived from Sukkot, and informed us that Melek Backeet,
and his great coadjutor the Cadi Esau, are at Fakeer el Bint,
and in the desert, waiting for the Bey Zadé[45] and his caravan,
knowing that we intended to pass, and believing us loaded with
gold, which we had found in the temples. The news produced the
greatest consternation among my little troop. The soldiers were
more pusillanimous than the rest. One of the Turkish officers, a
cowhass, who last night, at Haffeer, talked loudly of his valour,
had this morning not a word to say. Such a change of countenances I
never witnessed: even my own servants were afraid to proceed. With
such an escort, and uncertain of the force of the Mahas, it was
impossible to attempt to pass. I, therefore, sent to the katshef of
Haffeer for a reinforcement: he advised me not to advance, as the
news was quite true. A reinforcement he could not give, as he had
only twenty soldiers to guard the indigo-house.

_May_ 21. This morning I returned to Haffeer, and having ascertained
from several peasants and couriers that Melek Backeet had already
with him 100 men, and that the number was increasing hourly,
I abandoned the idea of continuing my journey without additional
force. I, therefore, sent my dragoman to the mahmoor with a letter,
begging him not to delay, but send immediately a sufficient number
of soldiers to clear the country of the insurgents. Were I alone,
I would run the risk, and attempt to cross the desert, or rather,
with a compass in my hand, make a circuitous route. This plan would,
perhaps, have enabled me to elude the enemy; yet, unfortunately, they
have their spies in every direction, even in Dongolah. My departure
would be reported; and although I were to sacrifice my baggage, their
horses, swift dromedaries, and superior knowledge of the country,
would enable them easily to overtake me, or intercept my route. For
myself, I would run any hazard, rather than endure, a day longer,
the _ennui_ of being detained here; but the lives of others I have no
right to compromise. According to the arrangements I had made, I ought
now to have been in Europe. The heat is excessive, and increasing
daily, and my funds diminishing. As this delay will oblige me to pass,
with more haste, the antiquities below, my vexation may be imagined.

_Haffeer.—May_ 21. to _June_ 2. I was detained at Haffeer, in the
indigo-manufactory, twelve days. During this period, we collected
and made drawings of several plants. I publish three, which I think
may be interesting to the general reader, having mentioned them
repeatedly. One, in Plate IV., is the senna, a name, doubtless,
familiar to all. It grows wild upon the house-tops and in the fields:
the flower is yellow, and the leaves of a pale green. The other plant,
in the same plate, I have called indigo; but although very good
indigo is extracted from it, it is, in reality, a totally different
plant,—the Tephrosia Apollinea of botanists. Plate LII. is a drawing
of the Osshi, the Calotropis gigantea. There are large plains in
this neighbourhood entirely covered with it, and, as I have stated
in my description of Makkarif, it abounds also in the province of
Berber. The interior of the flower is of a pink colour; the buds
contain a pungent liquor, of the colour of milk, which, according to
the Arabs, blinds when put in the eye. The leaves are of a greyish
green. The apple, represented in the Plate, contains the seed and a
fine glossy silk. The plant varies from four to six feet in height,
and is extremely valuable to the natives, being almost their only
firewood; and, as I have stated before, many camel loads of charcoal
made from it are sent to Cairo, being excellent for gunpowder. Among
the others I found, the only one of any interest, and characteristic
of Nubia, was a small kind of rue, the Ruta tuberculata of botanists.

The mahmoor, having at his disposal a considerable body of troops,
which he had assembled, according to my advice, from different parts
of the province, was fortunately enabled to send out immediately
300 soldiers. The Turks having, on the last occasion, obtained 100
piastres and their expenses, again volunteered their services. Having
united with Melek Tumbol’s Arab forces, they marched against the
Mahas, who had rallied, in great numbers, under their old chief, Melek
Backeet; and this time had very judiciously stationed themselves on
a steep rock on a large island, near Hannek, making excursions day
and night, and rendering the roads quite impassable.

The commander of the expedition was the same brave fellow who took
such particular care of his person during the former engagement. He
encamped near the Mahas, and published a proclamation offering them
a general pardon. The Cadi Esau and many of the other sheakhs were
disposed to accept the terms, when another fanatic priest started
up, and upbraided them with their cowardice, treachery, and folly;
“since,” said he, “you know that the Turks will deceive you,
and it is evident that God has given our enemies into our hands; for
without seeking them they are come to us.” By this absurd harangue,
he kindled a wild enthusiasm, to increase which all the fakeers were
employed in writing charms on their weapons. The commander was afraid
to attack them, on account of their number and their strong position;
but the Turkish volunteers laughed him to scorn, and dashed forward
on horseback to charge the Mahas. Notwithstanding the formidable
position of the insurgents, many of them having fire-arms, and the
facility their situation afforded them of rolling down stones on
the Turks, yet such was the effect of the instantaneous and gallant
example set by the latter, that the soldiers followed _en masse_,
and soon dislodged and put to flight the unfortunate Mahas.

In this engagement they calculated that 170 were killed, and about
30 made prisoners. I myself saw here 105 pairs of ears on a string,
which the victors were conveying to the governor; and I am informed
the commander has another. Very many being shot in the river, their
ears could not be obtained. They brought also to Haffeer twenty-two
prisoners, linked together in a string, having their arms tied
behind their backs, in the ancient Egyptian manner. Their arms were
drawn together behind with a rope, attached a little above their
elbows; causing, of course, an unnatural and painful projection
of the chest. Some of them were apparently half-bred negroes, who
were or had been slaves. They were all tall athletic men, but wild
and haggard in their appearance, and seemingly insensible either
to pity or to suffering. Seeing them in pain, I begged the Turks
to loosen their cords, which they did as a favour to me; but the
prisoners seemed quite indifferent, and did not even thank me. I
persuaded the Turks, also, to liberate from the cords a young boy,
of twelve or thirteen, on account of his extreme youth; but the lad
has something roguish in his eye; so that, if the soldiers on guard
do not pay more attention than it is their custom to do, I flatter
myself that, before they arrive at Dongolah, he will profit by the
indulgence, and effect his escape.

On hearing of the defeat of the Mahas, I determined instantly to
start, conceiving that, though Melek Backeet and his followers have
escaped, they will, for at least a day or two, be too much engaged
in providing for their own safety to lose time, and risk their own
security, in waylaying travellers. The only danger is that of falling
in with them by accident among the rocky passes of the cataract, or
in the desert; and they would gladly get hold of us, not, perhaps,
for plunder, but as hostages for their own security. Now, however,
we were all willing to encounter every risk rather than support
this endless delay, and be any longer confined to the prison of a
wretched indigo-house, in which my artist, myself, and the two Turks
had only one small hot room to sit, eat, and receive visiters. The
heat is dreadful: no cool refreshing wind to mitigate the scorching
rays of a sun almost completely vertical; every breath of air heated
as if issuing from a furnace; even the evenings, after sunset, are
hot. At that time I generally went down to the river, the air on
the banks being less oppressive: from about midnight until sunrise,
and even a few hours after, it is very cool and delightful; and,
not to lose the enjoyment and benefit of that period, I have for
the last month slept, like the Arabs, in the open air.[46]

My caravan, being strengthened by some merchants who joined us,
became now rather formidable, and may be worth describing. My own
party consisted of eleven, including the _habeer_ (guide), two
Ababde, and three Hassanyeh, the owners of our two dromedaries and
six camels. My artist and myself were well armed, and my dragoman,
and Greek and Coptic servant, also had muskets, with which the Mahmoor
had provided them. My guide had fire-arms, and the Arabs their lances
and swords: therefore, including the guard which the governor had
given me, of a baractar and six soldiers, my own party consisted of
eighteen persons, of whom thirteen had fire-arms. The two Turks and
their two servants were provided with them; and their camel-drivers
were three Shageea armed with spears. Besides these, five merchants,
three with guns, joined my caravan. We were, therefore, altogether,
thirty men; twenty with fire-arms; and were thus, I think, a match
for 100 of the Mahas, with their matchlocks and lances: but we all
conceived it so very probable that we might meet a party of the
insurgents, that I directed each person to keep his musket in his
hand during the whole night.

We started at four in the afternoon, and marched until two in the
morning, ten hours, and encamped in the desert two hours before
arriving at Fakeer el Bint. The effect of the caravan winding along
the rocky banks of the cataracts in a line, one after the other,
on account of the narrowness and badness of the road, was very
picturesque. The variety of the costumes and armour; the numerous
Arab tribes,—for scarcely more than two or three of our party
belong to the same one,—Hassanyeh, Shageea, and Ababde; Berberenes
of Upper Nubia, and Fellaheen of the lower valley of the Nile;
Turks, Greeks, and Europeans,—all differing in dress, features,
and complexion,—formed an interesting group. I could trace the
gradations of colour, even in my own caravan, from the yellowish
Arab of Cairo to the darker native of Upper Egypt, and from the
brown Dongoloue to the dark-brown Shageea; but the latter are very
different in feature and complexion from the bluish-black of the
negro slaves belonging to the Turks.

We all preserved the strictest silence, which enabled me to enjoy more
the noise of the cataracts, the soft moonlight, and the romantic rocky
scenery: but while I felt the beauty of the latter, I was well aware
that the granite rocks and passes afforded an ambush for the Mahas,
which was not without danger to us, their unskilfulness and ignorance
being my only security. We met repeatedly parties of women and boys,
either acting as spies, or going, as they pretended, to Haffeer, their
houses being destroyed, and husbands and fathers dead. Their manner
was certainly suspicious, and I had some difficulty in preventing
my soldiers from treating them as spies. We passed several cottages,
now uninhabited in consequence of the revolt.

_June_ 3. We arrived, in two hours, at Fakeer el Bint, and found
the village entirely deserted. The Mahas, by their imprudent rising,
have entailed a long series of sufferings and wretchedness on their
families; even those peasants who took no part in it are ruined;
their houses destroyed; their oxen killed, and their water-wheels
broken. We may admire the enthusiastic courage of the chiefs, who,
born to command, could ill endure the proud contempt and degrading
punishments of their insolent oppressors; but we cannot but condemn
their guilt and rashness in sacrificing, without the remotest
chance of ultimate success, the lives and happiness of so many of
their countrymen. I observed, on an island near Fakeer el Bint,
several fugitives. The Nile forms, between this place and Solib,
a considerable bend, the distance along the banks, through the
province of Mahas, being nearly thirty hours’ march of a camel,
or about seventy miles, and by the desert only twelve hours, or
thirty miles. We entered the desert at three o’clock. Never have
I felt such excessive heat; every breath of air is baneful. I tried
to protect myself from it with a turban and umbrella, and even the
sheets of my bed were put in requisition. I made an endeavour to
construct a tent on my dromedary; but my efforts were fruitless,
the wind being too strong. I felt my mouth dry and parched, and would
have given even one of my drawings of Meroe for a glass of pure cold
water; but every drop we had was soon quite warm. Before dark we had
passed the mountainous and the only soft part of the desert, and at
midnight we encamped within nine miles of Solib. The rocks are chiefly
of serpentine, slate, sandstone, and granite, the latter often much
decomposed: there were also a few fragments of marble scattered about.

_Ruins of Solib.—June_ 4-8. This morning, being anxious to arrive at
the celebrated Temple of Solib, I started before sunrise, and, pushing
on my dromedary at a quick pace, I arrived there in two hours. The
first view of the temple is very imposing; standing proudly at the
extremity of the desert, the only beacon of civilisation in this
sea of barrenness. The situation of the temple is as picturesque
as it is extraordinary. The columns are so distinctly visible,
that, at a distance, it has almost the appearance of a Grecian
edifice. On approaching nearer, the effect is changed, but not
injured; for, though not Grecian, it is of the purest Egyptian
architecture. I rambled over it for some time, delighted with its
picturesque appearance: the plan of the temple is also beautiful,
and the architecture of the most chaste simplicity; but, as an
antiquarian, I could have wished for more remains of sculpture,
and tablets with hieroglyphics.

The first grand propylon of the temple is 600 feet from the river; but
the form and exact dimensions of it are now not distinguishable, being
entirely ruined, and the materials almost all carried away. From the
appearance of the rooms, which the reader will observe on a reference
to the Plan, there seems to have been the same economy of stone in
constructing of this propylon, which we shall presently observe in
the second. Behind the first are the remains of two sphinxes. One
of them is nearly destroyed, but the other is not so much injured
as to prevent my perceiving that the style of the sculpture has
been good; but in its present state I did not consider it worth a
drawing. I observed that the first and second propylons were connected
together. The Plan (Plate XL.) will show that in front of the second
there are the remains of two walls, which, no doubt, connected it with
the first. This is quite in conformity with the general construction
of Egyptian edifices. A flight of steps, now scarcely distinguishable,
led up into a court before the second propylon. This court, the
entrance into which is about 85 feet from the first propylon, is
70 feet long and 45 feet wide. It was ornamented with six columns,
the diameter of which is 10 feet; the traces of them only are visible.

_London. Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The remains of the second propylon are more considerable. Each wing
is 78 feet wide; the door in the centre, leading into the temple, 11
feet wide, making the total width 167 feet. The depth of the propylon
is 24 feet. It is remarkable, that this propylon is not, like those of
Egypt, a solid mass of stone, with only staircases, and, occasionally,
small rooms, but finished, and apparently used for habitations. The
one here contains three rooms on one side, and two on the other,
but without doors, and evidently constructed with a view of using
little stone, as the walls are not hewn smooth. This is an economy of
material rarely seen in Egyptian edifices. The doorway leading into
the temple is of the correct Egyptian form, the width of the centre
part, which is 17 feet long, being 13 feet, and that of the two ends,
which are each 3 feet long, being, as already mentioned, only 11 feet
wide. The recesses, thus formed in the centre of the doorways, add
very much to their architectural beauty. The view from this doorway
of the next court of the temple is very magnificent. This court is 90
feet long and 113 wide, and was ornamented with twenty-eight columns,
a single row on each of the north, south, and east sides, and two
on the west, being the side opposite to the entrance. There are
now seven of these columns standing, with the bud-shaped capital. I
observed a slight difference in their dimensions, but they are of
the purest Egyptian architecture; their circumference is 19 feet
4 inches, and intercolumniation 5 feet 5 inches. Few more striking
views are presented in any part of the valley of the Nile than the
first entrance from the second propylon into this court.

[Illustration: COLUMNS OF SOLIB.]

Plate XLI. is taken from this point, and will, I trust, give the
reader a correct idea of the magnificence and exquisite architectural
beauty of this temple. Five columns appear in this view, detached
from each other, proud monuments of the power and greatness of the
Egyptian conqueror Amunoph III., who erected them, and whose name
and titles are engraved in hieroglyphics on their shafts. They bear
also the name of the great divinity Amun Ra, to whom the temple
was dedicated. The remains of many of the columns are lying on the
ground; the roof is gone; and only one piece of architrave remaining,
supported by one of the most beautiful and perfect of the columns. The
architectural form of these columns is more light and elegant than
almost any specimens of the same kind in Egypt; at the same time
without losing that character of grandeur and severity, so much in
unison with its situation. The background to this view (as will be
seen in the Plate) is the trackless desert,—a vast yellow ocean,
bounded only by the horizon, without an eminence, or even hillock,
visible to relieve the eye; and that tide of sand which never ebbs,
driven on continually by the prevailing strong winds from the north,
and particularly the north-west, beats against the temple, and daily
encroaches on its remains. On the east side, at a short distance from
the ruin, towards the Nile, Isis seems still to extend her protection,
and a luxuriant and beautiful vegetation flourishes; but on the other
sides Typhon reigns in gloomy solitude, and the traveller turns with
delight from the contemplation of the bleak and dreary wilderness,
to the elegant and magnificent work of art which adorns its margin.

Plate XLII. is a view I made which shows all the seven columns
which remain in this court.[47] Waddington speaks of the red tints
of the sandstone: there are a few, but very few, the general colour
being much whiter than that of any Egyptian or Ethiopian ruin I have
seen. I was in doubt whether to consider it as arenarious limestone,
or sandstone; but the specimens I brought to England have been
decided to be sandstone. The background of this view, consisting of
the river and distant hills, is very pretty. The view is taken from
the last existing room; and the reader will perceive to the right,
in the foreground, the fragment of a column on which is one of the
representations of prisoners which adorn all the columns of that
room. The next court is more destroyed; yet there are sufficient
traces of the columns to show precisely what the plan has been. It
is of the same width as the last court, and 78 feet long; and was
ornamented with two rows of columns on the north and south sides,
and on the east and west with one only; in all, thirty-two. The
circumference of each is 17 feet; but not one of them is standing.

TEMPLE OF AMENOPH III, SOLIB.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The next chamber, which was apparently an intermediate room leading
to the sanctuaries, contains the remains of twelve columns, of which
now only one remains perfect. The capital is of a form generally
considered as Ptolemaic, but we have here authority for calling it
Egyptian. It represents branches of the palm tree, and near the base
of these columns there is some interesting sculpture; a number of
prisoners, represented with their heads and busts resting on turreted
ovals, containing the names of the countries whence they come; and, to
signify that they are prisoners, their hands are tied together behind
their backs, in the usual Egyptian manner, tight above the elbows,
causing a painful and unnatural projection of the chest. The prisoners
on the columns on the north side of this room have beards and hair;
and some, without hair, appear to be old men. Their features are
fine, and have very little of the Negro cast. On the opposite side,
the prisoners represented are youths with their hair tied in a knot
a little below the crown of the head, and hanging down almost to
their shoulders. These have very much of the Negro features, wide
nostrils, thick lips, and high cheek-bones. I copied the names of
thirty-eight of these provinces: the only one I could make out was
that of Mesopotamia, in hieroglyphics.

On the column in this room which still preserves its capital, is some
sculpture, in a good style, representing the king presenting offerings
to Honsoo, with the globe and short horns for a head-dress. The
remains of the temple extend a hundred feet beyond this room;
so that the entire length of the edifice must have been about 540
feet, and the number of columns with which it was adorned, and whose
situation can now be accurately ascertained, is eighty-four. There
must, however, have been a greater number; for among the confused
piles of stone which are stated above as extending a hundred feet
beyond this room, I found some fragments of columns 3 feet in
diameter. (Plate XLIII. is taken from this end of the temple.) This
is also an extremely beautiful point of view; but although not even a
small stone is omitted, and notwithstanding the temple is so ruined,
the reader will perceive that there is no excess of shapeless masses
of stone to spoil the effect of the splendid architectural remains of
the edifice. The column I have described with the Ptolemaic capital is
the most prominent object in this view; but the picturesque grouping
of the columns of the great court is finely exhibited from this point.

On the door leading from the first great court into the second,
the king is represented with a staff in his hand, addressing Amun
Ra, who has the usual sceptre of the gods. Above the latter is
the king presenting offerings to a divinity, the hieroglyphical
titles of which are not legible; but the wings of the goddess of
truth are visible. Behind the second propylon, there has been some
very interesting sculpture, but it is now scarcely perceptible:
the figures were apparently only one foot high. One piece I copied,
which had some of the hieroglyphics remaining; but above this I could
only distinguish the divinities with the attributes of Horus, Thoth,
Anubis, Osiris, and Amun Ra, to whom the temple is dedicated. This
sculpture is in basso relievo. It is much to be regretted that
it is so defaced; for, doubtless, it has been a most interesting
mythological tablet. Some of the blocks of stone are harder than
the others, but the greater number are exceedingly soft, doubtless,
one cause of the ruined state of the temple, and why the sculpture
is scarcely distinguishable.

The remains of the ancient city extend for a considerable distance
both towards the north and south. On the bank of the river, 240
yards farther north than the temple, are the remains of a small pier,
13 feet high, and 20 feet long; while 200 yards to the north of this
pier is a projection of stones into the river, thrown in apparently to
form a port. This has evidently been a city of some importance. Its
situation, at the commencement of the road across the desert, is
also deserving of attention. The town was advantageously situated,
being on the route both of those who followed the banks of the river
and also of those who crossed the desert.

Ptolemy places the great cataract at 22° 30′; Φθουρι, at 21° 20′;
a difference of 1° 10′. The real difference of latitude is 1° 27′;
that is, 17′ more; but Autoba, the town he mentions before Phthouris,
is stated to be only 54°, that is, 23° less than the ascertained
difference; and Pistre, which is the next town he mentions after
Phthouris, is 1° 50′ from the cataract; that is, 23° too far distant.
We have thus, I think, no other alternative than to suppose this to be
the site of Phthouris, which, from the magnitude of the ruins, must
have belonged to a city of great importance, and one that he would not
have omitted to mention. The Temple of Siscé is probably the site of
Pistre.

After the pyramids of Meroe, this is decidedly the most interesting
and magnificent ruin we have seen in Ethiopia; superior to the former,
perhaps, in picturesque and architectural beauty, but less interesting
to the antiquarian, as being Egyptian, and not Ethiopian. It is
worthy of remark, that, with the exceptions of the colossal statues
of Argo, I have not met with any genuine Ethiopian remains since I
left Gibel el Birkel. Travellers who extend their tour of the Nile
to the second cataract, would be amply repaid for their additional
fatigue, if they visited this temple.

We found, on our arrival at Solib, a number of merchants detained
there on their way to Dongolah, on account of the insurrection. They
were delighted to see us arrive, and prepared immediately for their
departure. They complained bitterly of their long detention and great
consequent expense. Solib is almost at the extremity of the province
of Mahas; but, the peasants of this end of the province not having
taken any part in the revolt, we were comparatively secure, although
Melek Backeet, their chief, has a house in the neighbourhood. I lived
under a shed at a short distance from the temple, and remained there
four days, working almost from sunrise until sunset, regardless of
the extreme heat. I now required a sheep every day for my caravan,
which I had some difficulty in procuring, having had repeatedly to
send across the river. I fortunately provided myself with a large
stock of bread and biscuit at Dongolah: there is none to be had here.

_June_ 8. At the quick pace of the dromedary, I was twenty minutes
in going, this evening, from the temple to the village of Solib. It
is remarkable for the cottages being made, like those of the latter
in Mahas and Dongolah, of the stalks of the dourah, and branches
of the palm tree: here, however, the foliage extends considerably
above the roofs of the huts; and thus not only protects them in some
degree from the rays of the sun, but gives them a very picturesque
and graceful appearance. The house of the sheakh of the village is
fortified with square towers.

TEMPLE OF AMENOPH, SOLIB.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

About a mile beyond the village is the rock called Doshe, which,
projecting into the river, divides the province of Mahas from
Sukkot. It is of sandstone, and contains traces of iron ore:
its surface is rugged, and in part blackened by the sun, forming a
striking contrast to the bright yellow sand which covers the central
part of the rock. At the eastern end, above the river, is an excavated
tomb, which contains some traces of sculpture, though now scarcely
distinguishable. I perceived, from what remains, that it was in a good
style of basso relievo. There were some ovals, but no hieroglyphics
on them at all legible. I endeavoured to make out the name, and,
from the slight fragments remaining, I conceived one to be that of
Thothmes III., and another that of Osirtisen III., but must confess
I could not make them out at all satisfactorily.[48] At the end of
the tomb are the remains of three divinities, seated. The sculpture
of these does not seem to have been good, but they are so defaced,
that it is impossible to decide upon the style. On each side of
the divinities is a niche. The site of this tomb is picturesque,
commanding a fine prospect of the river. (See vignette.) Above
it a king is represented making offerings to a divinity with the
attributes of Kneph, and behind the latter are two other divinities,
one with a plain helmet, the other a vase on her head. Beneath
the line containing these subjects is another containing a figure
kneeling, and a long tablet of hieroglyphics; but the latter are
so broken and defaced, that only one here and there is legible. On
the south side of the tomb is a beautiful little piece of sculpture,
representing a king making offerings to Amun Ra, with the head-dress
of the globe and short horns; and behind the last is a goddess. The
name of the king seems to have been broken off designedly, and the
hieroglyphics are very much defaced.

[Illustration: FROM A TOMB EXCAVATED OUT OF THE ROCK NEAR SOLIB.]

_June_ 8. We left the village of Solib, and province of Mahas,
at four o’clock, and arrived at the village of Sukkot at six in
the evening. This is rather a large place, and the residence of the
katshef. I observed, in passing, four of the fortified houses of
the sheakhs; the rest of the houses are of mud: there are some few
of the palm leaves, but not so picturesque as those of the Mahas.

[Illustration: TEMPLE OF SUKKOT.]

[Illustration: TEMPLE OF SUKKOT.]

We stopped to examine some ruins, called by the peasants, Biban. The
first consists of two fragments of columns, around which are the
traces of the temple. The plan is Roman-Egyptian, and is rather
curious, though not good. (See vignette.) Three hundred and fifty
yards to the north there is another ruined temple. One column is
standing amid a mass of large stones: it reminded me of the solitary
column, and the vast masses around it, of the Temple of Hercules at
Girgenti; but the comparison is very degrading to the great beauty
of the latter. The capital of this is almost entirely defaced,
but it has decidedly been a head of Athor. On some of the stones
I observed fragments of Egyptian ornaments, and the fragment of a
name, apparently Amunoph III. The column is fluted, but not in the
usual Egyptian style, being much more flat. Attempts have apparently
been recently made to throw it down, or break it to pieces, its
architectural ornaments being quite obliterated. Its circumference is
12 feet 8 inches. East of the temple is a basalt statue, the sculpture
of which seems to have been very good, but it is very much injured. On
the interval between the two temples, and also for 350 yards beyond,
extending thus over a space of 700 yards, there are traces of the
city. These may be called the ruins of Sukkot, from their vicinity
to that village, which is the chief place of the province.

It is very difficult to ascertain what was the ancient name of this
place. The situation of the ruins agrees better with the position,
according to Ptolemy, of Phthouris, than Solib; but the insignificance
of the remains here, compared to the splendid ruins of Solib, prevent
my imagining it to be that city. It may be one of the many mentioned
by Pliny, or the Autoba of Ptolemy.

Half an hour after we left this ruin we passed the village of
Gobetziteen. I observed a large caravan of slave merchants from
Dongolah, who had left Solib this morning: their numerous fires,
and the groups seated under the palm trees, were very picturesque,
presenting effects that even a Gherardo della Notte could scarcely
have done justice to. They complained of the detention at Dongolah
having cost them so much. The expense of transporting the slaves
from Kordofan, or Abyssinia, to Cairo, is very great; the duty alone,
besides the maintenance, is nearly seven dollars each. They pay duty
at four different places: at Kordofan, at Dongolah, at Deroueh near
Assuan, and, lastly, at Boulak near Cairo.

We stopped at the village of Essau, opposite to the Island of Hadji
Falme. On the latter they tell me that there are antiquities, but all
broken; and I could not procure a boat to visit them. Being rather
late of arriving, I found the inhabitants of the village sleeping in
the open air; the women on the angoureebs, and the men on mats: and,
I can assure the reader, it is a great enjoyment, in this climate,
to sleep thus beneath the clear blue sky. About ten o’clock the
air becomes rather cool, while at midnight and in the morning it is
comparatively cold: this invigorates the frame, after the enervating
heat of the day; and, in this climate, there are no fogs or damp to
dread. It is the only time that I can now enjoy; yet I support the
heat better than my servants, though accustomed to that of Egypt all
their lives. We are exposed nearly the whole day to a sun almost
directly vertical, without a breath of cool air to alleviate our
sufferings. The wind generally blows from the north, but, instead
of being refreshing, it is so heated, in passing over the desert,
that it not only feels oppressive, but dries up the mouth and skin,
and checks perspiration. The Arabs, under the shade of their palm
trees, and smoking their pipes, enjoy this hot weather; but the
unfortunate traveller, exposed to these scorching winds, and to the
heat reflected from the rocks and sand, has no other respite to his
sufferings than during the now short nights.

_June_ 9. At Gobetziteen the Island of Sais commences, and extends
for six hours towards the north. At this season of the year no boat is
necessary to visit this island, the water which separates it from the
main land being only deep enough to reach the knees of the camels. It
contains no remains of Egyptian antiquities. The peasants spoke of
ruins; but they proved to be some grey granite columns belonging to a
Christian edifice. They are in the centre of the island, nearly half
an hour from the river. Each column consists of one piece of granite,
with a Greek cross on their capitals. They are not very unlike the
Christian monolithic pillars in the centre of the splendid portico
of Medenet Abou. There are a great many wells in this island, with
water-wheels, by means of which a considerable part of the interior is
irrigated. I had a drawing of these Christian ruins taken by Mr. B.;
but, not setting much value on it, I have mislaid it. From the number
of houses the island appears to be populous. An hour beyond Sais,
and four hours from Essau, we stopped at a small village of five
huts, called Kasr Towaga, from the brick ruins of a castle of that
name close adjoining.

The ride this morning was most uninteresting; a slip of uncultivated
land, narrower than even in the most barren parts of Lower Nubia,
separating the river from the bleak and dreary desert. In the latter
I observed several hills of light sand, which a strong wind would
easily move, to the risk, perhaps, of the unfortunate travellers who
might happen to be near. These moving masses of sand would baffle
the efforts of cultivators more advanced in knowledge than the
Nubians. It is not, therefore, surprising that these unfortunate
beings consider as useless any attempt to resist so relentless an
invader. The islands, protected by the river, afford them a refuge
and support, without which this part of the valley of the Nile would
soon be abandoned to the gazelles and beasts of prey. Our camels
often sank up to the knees in sand. I observed on the latter great
quantities of scarabæi. I have often seen these insects on the
sand in parts of the desert where it was difficult to conceive how
they could exist. Perhaps they live on other insects too minute to
be seen by the naked eye. I once gave a scarabæus a date, and was
astonished with what avidity he devoured a part of it, till he was
completely gorged, and apparently half dead.

I observed here a curious thrush, which is also very common near
Dongolah. One I killed measured nine inches in length, including the
tail, which is four and a half. The under part of the wings is of
a light brown colour, and the lower feathers of the tail are edged
at the extremity with white; otherwise, the plumage is entirely of
a brownish black. The beak and legs are black; the former is curved.

At Kasr Towaga I wished to visit the remains of the Temple of Amarah,
on the eastern bank; but for several hours I despaired of procuring
a raft or boat, or any other means of crossing the river. After
waiting some time, I observed at a distance a Sukkot ferry-boat, and
immediately offered nine Turkish piastres to an Arab to go for it,
and the same sum for the boat; and, as the camel-drivers began to be
mutinous at the idea of being detained another day, I promised them
a backsheesh of eighteen piastres; but such is the character of the
Arabs in this country, that, so long as they have enough to procure
any kind of food, they will seldom exert themselves to procure
more. They prefer to live miserably, scarcely better than their
fellow-labourers the camels, rather than to better their condition,
secure an independence, and a provision against a day of distress.

To increase their possessions, and elevate themselves to a higher
rank by their activity and frugality, are ideas which never enter
the minds of these children of destiny. If they earn a little money,
or if some favour of fortune places unexpectedly in their hands a
hundred piastres, they more generally spend it in a few nights of
festivity, and burden themselves with the expense of another wife,
than reserve it for the day when the fickle goddess may cease to
befriend them. With what alacrity would a poor European accept the
offer of 9 piastres (2_s._ 3_d._) to walk two miles for a boat! How
gladly would a European boatman earn the same sum by merely ferrying
us across the stream; yet it was more by threats than by this offer
(although equal to eighteen days’ wages) that I induced one of my
camel-drivers to go, during the heat of the day, for the boat. As,
of course, I promised the reward only in case of success, he was
unwilling to undergo this little fatigue on an uncertainty. My
firman was also necessary to dispose the boatmen to earn more in
twenty-four hours than they certainly have gained during the whole
of the past week.

My camel-drivers were very mutinous when they found me determined
to pass the night at Amarah: my guide threatened to leave me, but he
changed his tone when I told him to go, and declared I would not pay
him. By the present of eighteen piastres, added to certain threats
of the _korbash_ (whip made of the hide of the hippopotamus), if they
annoyed me, order was restored. Backsheesh has great influence on the
Arabs, but without a certain degree of firmness they are sometimes
difficult to manage.

We crossed the river, landed on the eastern bank, and went to the
nearest village, called Heber. We found the sheakh and the principal
inhabitants assembled under the shade of the palm trees. The sheakh,
a noble-looking fellow, with that dignified gravity which I have
so often found among the Arabs of this rank, received us with the
usual attentions; and, in compliance with my request, immediately
procured us donkeys, and conducted us to the village of Amarah,
a ride of an hour and a half. The sheakh had a house at Amarah, to
which he took us, and gave us an excellent supper and angoureebs to
sleep on, which are very necessary here, on account of the number
of scorpions. The road between the villages of Heber and Amarah is
through the desert. I found on it some beautiful specimens of red
Egyptian jasper and hornstone nodules. We passed a large mountain,
called Hadjer el Heber, of a very imposing appearance, which we
had remarked this morning, on the opposite side of the river. It is
about ten miles distant from the Nile.

[Illustration: PLAN OF THE TEMPLE OF AMARAH.]

The Temple of Amarah is about half an hour’s walk from the village
of the same name, and is situated between the villages of Heber and
Amarah, in the desert, to the right of the road we passed. There is
sufficient remaining of the Temple of Amarah to exhibit the style
and epoch. The architecture is Ethiopian (see Plan). A gateway,
19 feet wide, and ornamented with two columns, fragments of which
are remaining, 3 feet 8 inches in diameter, leads into a room 53
feet by 30, ornamented with eight columns, also 3 feet 8 inches in
diameter. Not a fragment of their capitals remains; but a considerable
portion, covered with sculpture, of each column is standing.

The sculpture on the columns is Ethiopian, but very indifferent,
and the hieroglyphics so wretchedly executed, and so defaced, that
it was scarcely possible to decipher any of them. The lowest row
on the columns represents divinities of the Nile, besides which I
observed a goddess with the globe, long horns, and two feathers,
perhaps Koht, another with a plain helmet such as Neith often wears;
and there is a representation of a king making offerings to Kneph,
represented with a ram’s head, globe, and two feathers; and also to
Thriphis, with a tiger’s head; a plain figure of Amun Ra, and the
same with the figure of a mummy and globe and two feathers: I also
remarked Honsoo with the globe and short horns. In the centre of the
columns is a line of hieroglyphics, which I copied as well as their
ruined condition would permit: they contain some curious titles, and
the name of a king which is unknown. I conceive the temple to have
been dedicated to Kneph, as the representations of that divinity are
more frequent, and in more conspicuous situations, than the others.

The foundations of the temple are of brick, and, for some distance
around, are scattered fragments of pottery with branches of the palm
tree painted on them, remains, no doubt, of the ancient city. The
columns are of sandstone. Plate XLIV. (see Frontispiece) shows two of
them in detail, and their situation in regard to the Nile, or rather,
I should say, as the river is not visible, to the palm groves on
its banks, and will enable the reader to judge of the style of the
sculpture. Ptolemy places the second cataract in latitude 22° 30′,
and Berethis, on the eastern bank, 21° 30′. The difference of
1° agrees very exactly with the distance between the cataract and
the ruins of Amarah.

The country on this side of the Nile is richly cultivated, and
the inhabitants bear no appearance of poverty. Notwithstanding the
heavy taxes which they pay, those who are industrious may easily
earn sufficient to render them comfortable. I saw about thirty of the
peasants, who were all particularly clean and well-dressed. A party of
them were feasting on raw liver. The custom of eating raw kidneys and
liver is very common south of the second cataract. The same custom is,
I understand, very general in Syria, and once existed in Scotland. I
observed here, also, a custom which I had often heard of, but never
before witnessed. When an Arab loses any near relation, his friends
are expected to condole with him on his loss, by literally mingling
their tears with his; for they place their cheeks together, and sigh
and sob often for ten minutes at a time. This custom in the land of
crocodiles reminded me of our expression of “crocodile tears.” A
French merchant, Sheakh Ibrahim, who has often visited these regions,
was described to me as a perfect Arab; and when I asked why, “Oh,”
said they, “he eats raw liver, and cries as we do.”

[Illustration]

I saw here a description of guitar, which is very common in Upper
Nubia, but it may be called the guitar of the Shageea, as that tribe
possess more beautiful ones than are found elsewhere. They consist,
as the vignette will show (see vignette), of a circular bowl,
about nine inches in diameter, of wood, or sometimes of the shell
of a tortoise of the Nile: this is covered with prepared sheepskin,
in which are six small holes, marked E. The three sticks B, C, D,
are generally of acacia; but in Dar Shageea they are sometimes of
ebony, and ornamented with silver and ivory. There are five cords
attached to the cross stick C, but they have no pegs, merely folding
several times round the latter in rather a clumsy manner: they,
however, manage to tighten them. F is a string to attach it to the
wall; and G is a plectrum, with which they strike with their right
hand the cords near the bridge; playing, at the same time, with the
left. Their music is wild and simple,—little variation in it,—but
some of their airs are not unpleasing. The reader will perceive, from
the vignette, that the form is not very unlike that of the Greek lyre.

_June_ 10. We returned at noon from the Temple of Amarah to the
village of Kasr Towaga; started from the latter place at two in the
afternoon, and advanced five hours in the desert. The first part of
this wilderness is desolate and frightful, beyond any I have ever
seen. After a short space its appearance became still more terrible,
resembling a sea agitated and driven into the most awful shapes
by wild winds. For the first few hours the ground was covered with
pebbles and quartz nodules of various colours. The rocks, which are
of gneiss, serpentine, and flinty slate, occasionally appear. Four
hours after starting, we passed a mountain called Hellal, of a
conical shape, the second we have observed of this form since we
left Kasr Towaga; and an hour afterwards we encamped in the desert.

_June_ 11. We started at sunrise; and in half an hour entered among
a chain of granite rocks; fine, bold, roundish masses, having all
the appearance, at a distance, of being detached and piled on each
other. In two hours and a half from the time we started, we arrived at
the Nile, opposite the Island of Dahl. For some time before arriving,
we observed, on the eastern bank, a fine eminence, which, at one
point of view, reminded me somewhat of the western mountain of Thebes,
although smaller, and of a less brilliant colour. The place at which
we stopped (see vignette) offers one of the most picturesque views
in the Batn, or Wady el Hadjar, into which we have now entered. The
Island of Dahl is the principal object: on a picturesque rock, in
the centre of it, is a fortified castle of a sheakh, the successor,
perhaps, of one of the forts on the islands represented on the walls
of Thebes.

[Illustration: ISLAND OF DAHL IN THE WADY EL HADJER.]

The latter part of the small desert I passed this morning was strewed
with quartz, generally white. The gneiss of which the rocks, at the
commencement of this little desert, are formed, is soft, friable,
disposed in strata: there are also rocks of mica slate of a grey
colour. The granite rocks, at the other extremity, consist almost
entirely of felspar and quartz; the former predominating, with very
little mica: the grain is extremely coarse, generally very friable,
of a pink, but mostly of a grey colour. There were also in this
desert some rocks of felspar, porphyry, and a great variety of
granite—tone-granite, syenite, and others.

At two o’clock, we left, with great reluctance, the shade of the
doum trees, and the enjoyment of one of the most beautiful views in
the valley of the Nile, to encounter again the horrors of the desert
and a burning sun. For the first part of our route, the rocks were of
syenite. The circular summits of these dark red rocks were visible as
far as our view could reach, rising sometimes in hills, but mostly
in pyramidal and conical forms. I observed a line of calcareous
rock about 13 feet broad, almost resembling the foundations of a
wall, which crossed the road, and extended east and west among the
granite rocks. This was followed again by the granite; and shortly
after these was a similar narrow, but less regular, cross of jasper,
and also one of porphyry. I brought away no specimens of the latter,
for the masses were large, and difficult to break. Afterwards, we
had a succession of granite, porphyry, compact felspar, hornblende
slate, grey gneiss, and serpentine; and the rocks, immediately before
arriving at the Nile, were of syenite.

We passed this little desert in five hours, with great fatigue to
the camels and the men on foot, on account of the sand and heat. We
encamped, for the night, at the small village of Uckma, which consists
of only eight houses; but I am informed that this is the name of the
district, as there are two other little villages, one on the opposite
side of the river, and the other on the island, which bear the same
name. My servants, or, rather, my guide and camel-drivers, made us
pass for Turks; saying, that the peasants of this district were so
bigoted, that, if they knew us to be Christians, no consideration
would induce them to supply us with either milk or meat for ourselves,
or straw for our camels. The noise of the cataract here is very fine.

_June_ 12. A curious circumstance happened to me last night. I
am rather attached to a pretty little capuchin monkey which
I received from the Governor of Berber, and which (an unusual
circumstance with these animals) shows some little gratitude for my
attentions. Several times it has escaped among the acacias of the
desert; but, notwithstanding the temptation of the gum, it never
attempted to run away when I went for it myself. I was anxious that
it should not share the fate of my Dongolah greyhound, and die of
fatigue. Having taught it to be clean, and being unwilling to trust
it to my servants, I carried it always on my own camel, to shelter
it from the sun; and as the poor little animal suffered exceedingly
from the cold at night, I allowed it to sleep under the margin of
the covering of my divan. For some nights past it had got into the
habit of laying its head on the corner of my cushion, and, amused at
this manœuvre, I indulged it; but the ticking of my watch always
annoyed it, and several times it had attempted to take it away;
but, aware of this antipathy, and the mischievous propensities
of the race, I always wore my chain around my neck. Last night,
when in bed, I looked at the watch, which was a hunting one, and
having broken the hinge of the gold covering of the face, omitted,
I presume, to fasten it with the spring. This morning, on being
called, I looked, as usual, at my watch, and found that this piece
was missing. I immediately cast my eyes on the monkey, and saw,
by its fluttering and leaping about, and the ruffling of its skin,
which always takes place when it is afraid, that it was the culprit;
yet all my efforts to find the covering were useless. My bed was on
the sand of the desert, in which, no doubt, the animal, on seeing
it loose, had buried it deep, thinking, by that means, to get rid
of its nightly annoyance, or, perhaps, from its usual instinct of
taking every opportunity to do mischief.

We set out an hour before sunrise, and, crossing a short but
heavy sandy desert, arrived, in two hours, at Lamulay. The rocks,
at starting, were of gneiss, but there occurred afterwards some of
serpentine and grey granite; and I observed some of quartz, and very
small particles of the latter disseminated over the sand. There is a
cataract at Lamulay, but it is not so loud as the one we heard last
night, at Uckma. The view is very fine at this part. We were two
hours in going from Lamulay to Tangoure. The rocks were chiefly of
two descriptions of quartz. We came then to another cataract, making
the sixth from Dongolah:—the first at Hannek; the second at Kouki;
the third at Dahl; the fourth at Uckma; the fifth at Lamulay; and the
sixth at Tangoure. All these may be passed without much difficulty
for about six weeks or two months in the year; but at this season no
description of boats could pass. Between the above-mentioned places
the river and the rocks on the opposite side make so many bends,
first east and afterwards north-west, that our roads, across the
little deserts, on the west side might often be considered as the
strings of a bow. On the eastern side of the river there seems to
be a continued range of picturesque rocks. We miss, I fear, much
fine scenery in not being able to follow closely the bank.

Two hours north of Tangoure there is said to be a spring of mineral
water, about 100 yards from the river, which flows in small quantities
out of the rock into an ancient reservoir, and is described as so
hot that the vapour will answer for a bath. I regretted much not
being able to visit it, but I must have gone on foot, and, being
to-day far from well, could not have endured the excessive heat;
but I have this information not only from the natives, but also
from Monsieur M., at Dongolah, who had visited it. We started from
Tangoure this afternoon, at half past two, and, after five hours’
march, halted in the desert for the night. The rocks are of granite,
serpentine, porphyry schist, and quartz. Strata of these minerals
occurred, sometimes alternately, every few minutes.

_June_ 13. Whenever there are antiquities to be seen, I care not
how little sleep I take. I had my men up soon after midnight, and
in three hours we arrived, as the sun was rising, at the Temple of
Semneh. This temple is more remarkable for its situation than for
architectural beauty. It consists of a single narrow room 28 feet
by 10 feet, with a plain façade, in the centre of which is the
entrance. The exterior sides of this room are ornamented with square
pillars, and one polygonal column. The temple faces the south, which
is singular, particularly for an edifice constructed by an Egyptian
king. On the eastern side are three square pillars standing entire,
and the base of another; and on the western one column, one square
pillar, and the base of a third. The view shows this side, and also
the façade of the temple. The pillars sustain blocks of stone,
that is, architraves, which still remain, projecting about one foot
beyond the columns. I thought, at first, from this projection, that
they might have extended to other walls; in which case the edifice
would have some resemblance to the sanctuary in the small temple
at Medenet Abou; but, from there being no remains to support this
supposition, and also from the projection being very small, and,
I might say, the architrave’s extending so far beyond the centre
of the column, I conceive that the temple has never been finished,
and the architraves hewn to the size of the columns.

[Illustration: TEMPLE OF SEMNEH.]

The interior and exterior of the walls of this little temple are
covered with sculpture and hieroglyphics; but, unfortunately, in some
parts, rather defaced. Over the entrance, the king is represented
on his knees making offerings to Kneph. The original sculpture of
part of the façade of the temple has been defaced to make room
for a more modern work, and for a long tablet of hieroglyphics,
which I copied. The sculpture, from its style, is certainly Roman;
the figures not well drawn, and the hieroglyphics wretchedly executed:
the subject represents a woman, with a lotus flower, making offerings
to a divinity with the head-dress of the horns and two feathers. The
hieroglyphics and sculpture of every other part of the temple are in a
good style. The name and titles of Thothmes III., Sun, Establisher of
the World, is executed in intaglio on the column and square pillars,
and the same name in basso relievo is every where visible on the
walls. In the interior of the temple the same subject is repeated
four times, but in only one instance is very distinguishable. (See
Plate LI.) The king, Thothmes III., is represented making offerings
to his ancestor Osirtesen, seated as a divinity in the boat of the
sun, with the crook and lash of Osiris in his hands.

Before Osirtesen are four standards, one with a representation
of the ibis, emblematical, no doubt, of Thoth: the others are not
visible. These standards are supported by arms emanating from the
cross of life, and the sceptres of the divinities; emblematical, I
conceive, of their being the standards of the gods, perhaps of the
divinities of Amenti, Thoth, Horus, and Anubis. One is of Thoth,
evidently, from the ibis; the others are defaced. The reader will
observe how different this style of sculpture (see Plate LI.),
which is the best Egyptian, is to the Ethiopian (see Plate X.). They
have evidently had a common origin; but there is a marked difference
in the execution. On the western side of the exterior of the temple
the king is represented making offerings to different divinities,
principally Kneph. I copied all the hieroglyphic inscriptions. The
hieroglyphics on the columns and pillars are merely the names of
Thothmes. The column which I have stated as polygonal has a base
and a square slab for its capital.

SCULPTURE IN THE TEMPLE OF SEMNEH.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

In the interior of the temple is the fragment of a statue of
Osiris, badly executed: the head is wanting, and on the breast is
the crook and lash. I conceive the style to be Egyptian Roman. It
is very probable that this temple, originally dedicated to Kneph,
was afterwards, in the more corrupt Roman age, appropriated to the
peculiar worship of Osiris. This edifice (see Plan) is in a large
irregular brick inclosure, the walls of which are generally seven to
eight feet thick: this is not of Egyptian, but apparently of Roman,
construction. In some parts masses of brick project from the wall,
perhaps to support them; their ruined state makes it impossible to
decide certainly, but I am inclined to believe them to be entrances.

[Illustration: PLAN OF RUINS.]

I went to examine the pass or cataract of Semneh, which I had some
difficulty in reaching, having to climb for a considerable space over
the granite rocks. The latter are generally rose-coloured, extremely
hard; but there are some rocks of basalt shining like black lead, and
I observed light thin strata of quartz. The width of this channel,
the only one the Nile passes through, when it is low, I found to
be a stone-cast. The river rushes through with great rapidity, so
that I could not cross here from the number of vortices caused by
the excessive force and velocity of the current.

_June_ 14. Wishing to pass over the river to the temple on the
opposite side, I commissioned the sheakh to collect the inhabitants,
and make me some kind of boat. This morning, at eleven o’clock,
he came to inform me that a raft was ready, and men to steer it. My
Arabs having taken the camels and dromedaries to pasture at a distance
from the temple, I was obliged to set out on foot, and, after walking
three quarters of an hour, amid severe heat, I arrived at the place
where they intended to cross, fully two miles south of the pass or
cataract. The river in this part is about a third of a mile wide,
and, except in one or two places, where the current is rather strong,
it was scarcely ruffled. The peasants had constructed two rafts, one
for ourselves, the other for the servants. They were simply trunks
of the acacia lashed together, on which they placed dourah for us
to sit on. All the inhabitants of the country were collected to see
the expedition. Ten or twelve men, some on geerbahs (water-skins),
others on pieces of wood, supported and conducted each raft, two
or three on each side, and four behind, pushing it along. Doubting
the security of the boat, I had taken the precaution to take off
my clothes, and fasten them on my head, like the Arabs. This was
fortunate; for the dourah straw was soon saturated with water.

Nothing could be more picturesque than the boats and their
conductors. The Arabs had all their clothes tied on their heads,
and they carried their charms, arms, knives, swords and spears,
fastened in the same manner. Shouting and singing, they pushed us
across very cleverly: the only difficulty was in passing the parts
where the current was strong. We had also some little fear of the
crocodiles. Three Turks shot two in this very place only two months
ago, and yesterday we saw one on the shore. The peasants at first
refused to take us across for this reason, but the promise of a few
piastres more, and the use of my firman, silenced their fears. I
did not myself conceive that there was the slightest real danger on
this account, as I have observed that the crocodile invariably flies
from boats or any number of persons together. After landing we had
another three quarters of an hour of fatiguing walk to the temple on
the eastern side, which (see General View) is almost exactly opposite
the other. Some parts of our road was over low burning sand-hills,
in which we sunk at each step up to our ankles; the heat excessive
under a directly vertical sun.

[Illustration: TEMPLE OF SEMNEH.]

_Temple at Semneh. East side of the river._—In the first chamber
of this temple the door-posts of the entrance remain, and also
two polygonal columns without their capitals, and two square
pillars. (See vignette.) The lateral walls seem to have joined the
latter; both the square pillars and columns were ornamented with
hieroglyphics, of which the names of Thothmes III. are now only
distinguishable. The names, however, of Amunoph III. and Thothmes
II. occur in this temple. The entrance into the next room is filled
with rubbish up to the architrave; the latter is ornamented with
the winged globe, and a dedicatory tablet of hieroglyphics. There is
also another door to the right of this, leading into the interior,
with a similar tablet on the architrave. The walls were decorated
with sculpture in a good style, but now much defaced. In one place I
distinguished the head of Kneph, and elsewhere the same god receiving
splendid offerings of vases, fruits, &c. from the King Thothmes,
sun, establisher of the world. In another part, the king, with the
head-dress of the small globe, two feathers, and horns, is receiving
the cross of life from a divinity with a beard and no head-dress,
perhaps Amun Ra. Behind this latter figure is the god Kneph again,
with his usual attributes of the ram’s head and horns.

[Illustration: PLAN OF THE TEMPLE OF SEMNEH.]

These two entrances lead into a long gallery full of sand and
rubbish. I excavated below the level of the centre doorway into the
gallery, but it is singular that I could discover no entrance into the
sanctuary of the temple corresponding with it. The only one I found
is on the right side. There are three other rooms, one containing
a column. I believe they are marked accurately in the above Plan;
but, to ascertain very correctly how they are connected, would have
required more extensive excavations than my time permitted, nor did
I think it worth any sacrifice, for the plan is evidently bad. The
sculpture of these rooms is almost buried in the sand. There are
slight traces of colour remaining. At a short distance south-east
of the temple, on the granite rocks, are some hieroglyphical
inscriptions, but very rudely executed. I copied five that were
legible; they contain the names of Thothmes III. and Amunoph III.

These rocks are interesting as the last hiding-place of the Arab
robber, Isah; and it was in this neighbourhood that daring brigand
finally met his fate. Isah was a sheakh of the Karareesh tribe. A
katshef, near his residence, having threatened him with the bastinado,
unless he submitted to some exorbitant demand, he preferred abandoning
his domestic happiness, and the peace and quiet of agricultural life,
to such galling and vexatious tyranny. He fled into the fastnesses
of the desert, and there, with a few chosen followers, bade defiance
to the Pasha’s power. He infested the caravan road from Korosko
to Abouhammed; and the Dilet el Doum, or the Valley of the Shade of
the Doums, was his favourite resort. He was the terror of all the
caravans, like the lion of the desert; only allowing them to pass
when they had satisfied his demand: but it was against the government
that he was most active, plundering their caravans laden with grain
and other produce received as taxes, and seizing the numerous herds
of cattle which are sent down to Cairo every year, the spoil of the
war on the Bahr el Abiad and the Azruk. He sometimes also succeeded
in seizing the supplies of ammunition and arms from Cairo; but, what
was very annoying to the Turkish governors, he frequently seized the
caravans bringing them supplies of tobacco, coffee, sugar, and other
luxuries. For five years this daring outlaw eluded every attempt to
seize him. The governors made the most strenuous efforts to obtain
his head, and the Pasha engaged the Ababde to hunt him from the
great Nubian desert. His troop generally consisted of about twenty;
and when, for any important expedition, he required a greater force,
Arabs were never wanting to plunder the Turkish caravans. Most of the
sheakhs have an immense number of relations; often every individual
in their village is a connection; and when their chief is in peril,
or requires their services, they consider themselves bound to rally
around his standard, at whatever sacrifice or hazard. His wife,
like Rob Roy’s, shared her husband’s dangers; and his daughter,
Enour, is said to have had as stout a heart as her father, and as
much address in throwing the lance as any Arab of her tribe. For
five years they shared the perils of this bold brigand; but at
last Isah, driven out of the Ababde desert, was betrayed by an Arab
sheakh of this neighbourhood, who professed to be his friend. This
man, either from fear of the Pasha’s anger, or in the hope of
obtaining additional power and wealth by such an essential service,
conducted a company of soldiers to the valley where he was secreted,
and Isah, while sleeping under the shade of a rock, was shot dead. His
death was instantaneous, for it is said that twenty bullets entered
his body. His followers fled; but the fidelity of one of them was
ultimately rewarded with the hand of his daughter, Enour.

I returned to the ruin on the western bank by the same route, but
having passed the river, I fortunately found a donkey, which, though
a poor one, afforded me some assistance in ascending to the temple.

These edifices are not remarkable for their architecture; but
nothing can be finer than their situation. They are in sight of,
and almost opposite to, each other, on eminences commanding one of
the finest views in the Batn el Hadjar. This view has been compared
by some travellers to Tivoli; but, besides other dissimilarities,
there is here no ugly, ill-built, dirty, modern town, that detracts
from the beautiful situation of the antiquities. The prospects
near the western temple are very magnificent; Signor B.’s view,
Plate XLV., will give a just idea of the country: but the magical
effect of the desert, contrasted with the surrounding scenery,
can be but imperfectly conveyed to the reader’s mind, without a
view coloured, as this was, on the spot, exhibiting faithfully the
different tints. I regret not being able to publish the numerous
views as they were coloured on the spot by Signor B.

RUINS OF SEMNEH, on the East & West Sides of the River.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

The peasants here are of a dark-brown complexion, and wear their
hair bushy, but less so than the Ababde. They are poor, but have
the character of being honest. Some of them understand and speak
the Arabic, but the language of the country is the Nubian.

_June_ 15. We started for Wady Halfah, and, after six hours, halted
for the night in the desert. The rocks are of serpentine and granite:
this desert consists of immense plains covered with sand-hills,
and is quite different from the last we passed over, not being so
wild and dreary.

_June_ 16. We started three hours before day, and pushing on our
dromedaries, arrived at sunrise at the second cataract. According to
the practice of almost every traveller who visits the valley of the
Nile, I had made this the limit of my first journey, performed in
1832; but I was not then half so much astonished at the peculiarity
and magnificence of this scene. I did not see it at so favourable a
season, and, perhaps, I appreciate it the more from the delight I feel
that, although I have still a voyage of nearly 1000 miles before I
reach Alexandria, my fatigues may now be considered nearly finished,
as this day I change the slow and tiresome pace of the caravan for
the comparatively luxurious cangia. The effect of the rising sun on
the black shining basaltic rocks which project into the river, forming
innumerable islands, is very striking, and the picturesque beauty of
some of these is heightened by the curious contrast with the stripes
of light yellow sand which are mixed with them. These little rocky
islands, impeding and compressing the current, increase tenfold its
force; and the white foaming river, dashing over the rocks, makes
the colour of the dark shining basalt still more remarkable, while
the roar of its waters animates the scene. There is also a striking
contrast of the black basalt with the white calcareous rock, tinted
with red and other hues, which forms the foreground. The beauty of
the scene, although peculiar, is not diminished by this contrast,
any more than the often lovely form of the dark Abyssinian girl is
disfigured by the snow-white veil which covers her.

I have seen the beauties of the Alps, the Apennines, Arcadia,
and the Pyrenees; I have surveyed the lakes of Bavaria, England,
Italy, Scotland, and Switzerland; I have followed the Rhine from
Schaffhausen to the sea, and sailed on the Danube, the Rhone, and
many other rivers; but I must confess I never was more moved by
any view than this. I mean not to compare it to the landscapes of
Europe for magnificence, or what is generally considered picturesque
effect. This is a view of an extraordinary and peculiar kind;
for, besides the singularities of the landscape already described,
there are associations connected with it which cannot but excite the
traveller. The very solitude of the scene, where no habitation of
man is visible;—the extent of the view beyond the cataract, along
an immense desert of yellow sand, extending over the vast continent
of Africa;—then the river, forcing its passage through the rocks,
that threaten to stop the progress by which it carries to thousands,
and even millions, the means of subsistence;—and shall I say
nothing of the mystery which hangs over it? On its banks, perhaps,
first flourished the arts; its source is hidden in impenetrable
obscurity, as is also the greater part of the historical events
which the bordering countries have witnessed. The effect of the
rising sun gives a magical lustre to the rocks, extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to exhibit in a drawing. I made a camera lucida
outline of it, and Signor B. made a drawing in colours of the peculiar
tints and effects. When the Nile is high, it is more picturesque,
as, of course, there are then more islands.

2D. CATARACT OF THE NILE.

_Published by Longman, Rees & Co. April 6th. 1835._]

Numerous names of travellers are engraved on the calcareous rock;
this place being, as I have said, almost always the limit of their
voyage. Some few make an excursion into the Batn el Hadjar; but
fatigued with the first two or three days’ journey on camels,
they seldom proceed beyond Semneh, and still more rarely, if ever,
extend their journey to Solib, one of the most magnificent ruins
in the valley of the Nile. The extreme heat of these climates,
particularly during this season, is certainly trying to European
constitutions. As far as the second cataract, travellers visit the
antiquities, comparatively speaking, without any fatigue; in their
boats they suffer little from the heat, and they have seldom any
distance to walk, as all the ruins are on the banks. I, however,
strongly recommend those who are really fond of antiquities, and
are possessed of a good constitution, to complete their tour of the
Nile. Travellers visit with great fatigue the sites of Sparta, Troy,
and even Carthage, where there are no monuments to recompense the
toil. It is true that the recollections recalled by such scenes must
amply indemnify us; but in the Island of Meroe we have splendid and
most interesting works of art, an infinity of sepulchres, which,
from their number and extremely elegant architecture, could only
have belonged to the metropolis of that ancient kingdom: and what
more thrilling, exciting association could the traveller desire,
than the circumstance that in that region the arts had their origin?

The antiquities of the Island of Meroe, as will have been seen, are
not the only remains to indemnify the traveller for his fatigues. The
interesting site of Gibel el Birkel, with its extensive, picturesque,
and curious monuments; the pyramids of Nouri, the colossal statues
of Argo, and the temples of Solib and Semneh, are all interesting
in the extreme; and, besides the antiquities, the traveller cannot
but be interested in the manners and customs of a people who have
not yet adopted those of their conquerors. A knowledge of the desert
life, and the different tribes of Arabs, is only to be acquired by
a journey of this description through their different districts.

Some of the views of the desert are, to those unaccustomed to them,
somewhat appalling,—boundless oceans of sand; rocks affording little
or no shade to the traveller, and covered, sometimes, with hills of
light sand, which appear to want only a storm to put them in motion;
and it is a dreadful sight to see the road strewed with the bodies
of men and animals, victims of the scorching clime and great fatigue.

Often, when the wind has covered with sand the traces of former
caravans, we have no other beacon than the small piles of stones
which the Arabs occasionally erect on the eminences; but an almost
infallible guide to our steps is afforded by the bones which lie
bleaching on the road. Yet this is the dark side of the picture:
the desert life has its charms, which are only enhanced by these
dangers. We are there independent, perfectly free from the restraints
of the world, and those passions which agitate man in society.

All feel a pleasure in gazing on the ocean, and (when well) in sailing
on its bosom; but the desert life is still more delightful. I feel
it difficult to analyse this sentiment, and yet I strongly feel
it. At sea we are mere passengers; we take no share in avoiding the
dangers which threaten us; our powers are not called into action;
we feel a certain excitement, but, of course, less than the captain
and sailors, on whom all depends: and is not this a reason why the
latter are so attached to that kind of life, notwithstanding the
numerous and severe hardships which they have to undergo?

The traveller in the desert is, to a certain degree, similarly
situated. As head of the caravan, its safety depends mainly on the
prudential measures which he adopts. Appointing a guard in case
of danger, encamping in a judicious situation in case of a storm,
attention to secure a supply of water, and to prevent the Arabs from
consuming, as they would willingly do, two days’ portion in one
day, are cares which keep his mind constantly occupied. A judicious
choice of camels, drivers, and servants; a just distribution of
their labour, and attention to their maintenance, lessen the chance
of being detained by illness.

Well supplied with rice, good biscuit, and meat, the traveller may
live tolerably well, even in the deserts. Since I left Thebes, four
months and a half ago, I have passed two deserts of eight days each,
and many small ones, and generally been in a miserable country, yet
I have only been one day without fresh meat, and that by accident. To
court privations is as great folly as to fear them when they arrive,
and not submit to them cheerfully when requisite. I am certain that
wine and spirituous liquors are injurious in this climate. During the
whole of this journey water has been my only beverage; and, on the
whole, I have enjoyed very tolerable health, considering the excessive
heat, and the many annoyances and delays, still more injurious in
this climate than the fatiguing pace of the camel. The desert life
has also another charm; it is gratifying to see how, when treated
as men, the Arabs become attached to you. If they have any quarrel
between each other, a word from the traveller makes them silent.

At sea, it is a pleasure to observe the colour and motion of
the waters; to see the dolphins playing at the ship’s head;
and sometimes, as in the Mediterranean, the surface of the waters
animated by their singular forms. The Nile has its crocodiles and
hippopotami; every desert also presents something new,—lions,
panthers, hyenas, wolves, serpents, gazelles, antelopes, giraffes,
ostriches, guinea-fowls, wild asses, zebras, &c. The traveller
may have seen all these in menageries in Europe; it is, however,
a great pleasure to see or hear them in their native haunts. The
deserts have also a great charm for the traveller who has any taste
for mineralogy, then each rock, each pebble, each step, I may say,
is interesting. During a sea voyage, we read, and scarcely look at
the water once a day: in the deserts, on the contrary, our attention
is continually occupied by the transition of rocks, their formation,
the minerals which are disseminated on, and mixed with, the sand.

At sea, it is a pleasure to meet another vessel, to hail her, and
demand where she is from, and to what port she is bound; and we often
experience delight at finding the passing crew to be countrymen,
perhaps relations, or friends: but what pen can describe the meeting
of a caravan in the desert? Brothers, who have not seen each other
for months, and even years, often meet thus, by accident. The caravan
never stops; they have, therefore, only a few moments, and they must
part again, and run after their camels. Their hands locked together,
they inquire after each other’s health, and after that of their
friends. Travellers laugh at the repeated “_Taip een salamat, taip
een salamat_,” of the Arabs. “How do you do?—Good morning! How
do you do?—Good morning!” repeated twenty times; and “_Taip een
abouk? taip een ahouk? taip een omek?_” “How is your father? How
is your brother? How is your mother?” &c. always repeating the _taip
een?_ “how is?” to each person that they name. The indifference
with which the Fellaheen, who see each other daily, go through
this ceremony, may seem rather ridiculous; but in the deserts, as I
have seen them sometimes, even with tears starting from their eyes,
affection could not dictate a stronger and more appropriate manner
of inquiring rapidly, but particularly and separately, after each
relation and friend who is dear to them. Frequently have I observed
my Arabs meeting with their friends of other tribes, and even of their
own district or village, and witnessed the pure and natural joy which
illuminated their countenances; friends who have travelled together,
shared the same toils, the same dangers—companions of their youth,
of their early voyages, who have not seen each other for years,
meet in the solitudes of the wilderness, but for a moment only, and
the same period may elapse before they again see each other. Let
it not be supposed that, in the interior of Africa, the natives,
although ignorant and uncultivated, are destitute of honest affection.

It is, however, true, that sometimes in the desert we trace those
violent passions and habits which generally characterise the wandering
tribes of Central Africa. The Bishareen, and others, often plunder
the caravans; and tribes occasionally meet between whom there have
been constant feuds. Under the strong government of the Pasha, they
now seldom make use of their arms; but they exchange no salutes:
their silent manner of passing each other, the knitted brow, and
involuntary firmer grasp of their spears and swords, evince the
deadly hatred which still lurks secretly in their breasts.

The Island of Meroe is a classic region, whose name is familiar to
almost every reader, as the cradle of arts and civilisation. The
Nile was the source of her prosperity, and an object of adoration
to the ancient, and even to the present inhabitants[49]; yet most
of the great events which have given celebrity to the countries on
its banks, are lost in impenetrable obscurity. The names even of the
kings under whom she rose to such a height of greatness and power
are almost wholly unknown. So scanty are the materials which can
be found in the ancient writings and on the monuments, that it is
almost an act of presumption to attempt, in the slightest degree,
to penetrate the veil which envelopes her history.

Professor Rosellini, in his extensive and admirable work on the
antiquities of Egypt, has made many valuable observations on the
dynasty of Ethiopian kings who reigned in that country, which have
facilitated my researches; and I gladly testify, that the ruins in
Ethiopia, in many instances, confirm the conclusions which that
learned traveller drew from his examination of the monuments of
Egypt. Availing myself of the inquiries of the learned Italian, I
shall also put together the most important fragments contained in
history, and the valuable lapidary inscriptions I have been able
to copy from the antiquities. A country is always interesting,
to which we feel ourselves indebted for inventions from which we
now derive any important benefit; and as a nation thus rises in
our estimation, we become anxious to form an acquaintance with
its historical records. There is a charm even in its name, when it
recalls to our memory heroic deeds and other important associations.

It is not merely the wonders of art, surprising as they are, which
enchant the traveller at Rome and Athens. It is not the vast pile
of the Coliseum, the triumphal arches and temples in the Forum, the
exquisitely chaste architecture of the Temple of Theseus and of the
edifices on the Acropolis, but the crowd of thrilling recollections
of the heroism, genius, philosophy, and art, by which these scenes
were illustrated, that render them for ever classic and hallowed
in our eyes. Had there been no records of the history of Athens,
we should have wanted no other evidence of her civilisation and
knowledge than the splendid architectural monuments with which her
site is adorned. The Parthenon itself speaks volumes, and the most
eloquent pages of her greatest historians do not bear more conclusive
testimony to her civilisation, than the treasures of Grecian art and
taste in the museums of Europe. Had all the written records of her
valour and patriotism perished, our knowledge of Athens would have
been very nearly what it now is in regard to Ethiopia. The labours
of the historians of her land are lost; the brilliant deeds which
adorned her annals are enveloped in a cloud of mystery. The history
of her neighbours affords only a few scanty gleams, sufficient to
make us deplore the general darkness. So changed is the kingdom of
Meroe from what it must once have been, that I myself should have
almost doubted the short but important passages preserved in the
Greek and Latin authors, were they not triumphantly confirmed by
the monuments existing at Meroe and Gibel el Birkel.

The reader will, I trust, find in this and the following chapters,
that Ethiopia was not unjustly celebrated for civilisation, and as the
birth-place of many arts which now contribute highly to our welfare
and enjoyment; and the few fragments we have been enabled to glean
will prove that she had also her kings and heroes, and that her
history was diversified by the usual vicissitudes of triumphs and
reverses. I am obliged to refrain from publishing, on the present
occasion, all the names of the kings and inscriptions which I found
on the edifices of Meroe, Gibel el Birkel, Solib, Semneh, Toumbos,
and Amarah.

For the benefit of the learned, who peculiarly apply themselves to
this study, I give, however, a few of those inscriptions, which,
mutilated and imperfect as some of them are, the initiated in the
recent discoveries in hieroglyphics will immediately perceive to be
of the greatest importance, as the earliest undoubted records of
Ethiopian history. The inscriptions in Plates LII. and LIII., the
hieroglyphics of the Plates X. XI. and XII. of sculpture of Meroe, and
also many I am unable to publish, are curious, not only for the names,
but for the singular titles which they contain, for the mythology,
the variations in the appellations of the divinities, the names of
places, and other valuable historical matter.[50] Many scientific
men have urged me to publish the whole of these inscriptions; and
Signor Rosellini informed me that he should add another volume to his
work from these materials. I hope this able writer will not forget
his promise, and will excuse my employing it as an apology for not
undertaking the interpretation of any portion of them myself; as such
an attempt, on my part, would only be unsatisfactory to the learned,
and tiresome to the general reader.


  “Non nostrum tantas componere lites.”


The monuments of Egypt afford historical evidence of the wars between
that country and Ethiopia, during the 18th dynasty; that is, from
about the 13th to the 16th century before Christ. In the topographical
description I stated that the temples of Semneh were built by the
Egyptian king Thothmes III. I have been told that scarabæi have been
found, with the name of this king, opposite Gibel el Birkel.[51]
Amunoph III., the Memnon of the Greeks, has also left, as a monument
of his victories still farther in Ethiopia, the splendid Temple of
Solib. I thought, at first, that this was the Amunoph mentioned by
Josephus, who, at the second invasion of the Shepherds, took refuge
in Ethiopia until he had collected an army, and his son Sethos, or
Rameses, was of a sufficient age to lead it against the insurgents:
but both Eusebius and Africanus agree in calling Sethos the first king
of the 19th dynasty: therefore, as the Temple of Solib bears the name
of Amunoph, with the prænomen of Ⲣⲏ-ⲛⲉⲃ-ⲛⲧⲙⲉ, “Sun, Lord of Truth,” it
is of the eighth king of the 18th dynasty, and not the last: besides,
the representations of the countries conquered by that king are still
preserved, and prove, by some of them having the features of negroes,
that the splendid Temple of Solib was erected as a monument of his
victory and long possession of the country, and not of a mere alliance
with the King of Ethiopia.[52]

The successor of Amunoph III., Amulek, or, perhaps, more correctly,
Horus, as Eusebius and Africanus call him, must, I conceive, from
an inscription I saw at Turin, have also carried his arms into the
interior of Africa; but Herodotus[53] states, that only Rameses
II. (Sesostris) made himself master of Ethiopia; and it is singular,
as I have stated in the account of the ruins of Gibel el Birkel,
that the only fragment of the name of an Egyptian king which I saw,
either there or at Meroe, was half of the name of Rameses II.,
which I found, by accident, in the Arab burial-ground at the former
place. This is an extraordinary corroboration of the testimony of
the historian; for that conqueror must have possessed that Ethiopian
city for a sufficient length of time to erect or restore a temple;
otherwise I should not have found his name.

Diodorus mentions that, when Egypt was suffering under the dominion
of Amasis, a violent, proud, and arrogant man, Aktisanes, king of
Ethiopia, profiting by the discontent of the people, invaded Egypt,
and had little difficulty in overthrowing the tyrant, and taking
possession of the country, as the greater number of his subjects
were weary of his oppression, and rebelled against him. Aktisanes,
he adds, was a great prince, and built a city, called Rhinocolura, on
the confines of Syria and Egypt, and detained there the thieves whom
he had punished with the loss of their noses; from which circumstance
Rhinocolura had its name. Eusebius, Africanus, and Herodotus do not
mention this king. Diodorus’s account is difficult to explain;
for his Amasis cannot be the Amasis of Manetho, the first of the
18th dynasty; as Diodorus places his Amasis several reigns after
Sesostris or Rameses II. As there are no traces of the name of this
king on the monuments either of Ethiopia or Egypt, I see no reason
why we should receive the testimony of Diodorus, to the prejudice
of other historians; and, doubting, as I do, whether such a king
ever reigned in Egypt, I think it unnecessary to enter into any
discussion about the period of his reign.

We have also, about this time, an account of another king, whose name
is familiar to the classical scholar,—Memnon, the son of Aurora,
who killed Antilochus[54] in the Trojan war; and again, in the same
poem[55], he is called the most beautiful of warriors, the brother
of Priam; and Hesiod calls him the son of Aurora, and the king of
the Ethiopians. Monsieur Letronne, in his learned work on the vocal
statue of Memnon, has treated the whole story as a romance; but though
we may refuse our credence to the embellishments of the Greek poets,
tragic writers, and historians, I must confess myself of the opinion
of those who believe in the possibility that the statement of a king
of Ethiopia of that name having gone to the assistance of Troy may,
perhaps, not be without foundation. The distance was certainly very
great; but navigation by the Nile, or the Red Sea, would obviate, in a
great measure, that difficulty; and it is not much more extraordinary
to read of an Ethiopian king going to the relief of Troy in the 13th
century before the Christian era, than, in the tenth century, to read
of a king, called Zerah, who, with a host of a thousand thousand, went
unto Maresha; and, in the 8th century, we find that Tirhaka assisted
the King of Israel against Sennacherib, which event I will presently
relate. History, both ancient and modern, affords many instances of
wars between very distant states, and of expeditions sent against
remote kingdoms, often even from continent to continent. I think,
therefore, that it is not very surprising that the Ethiopian king,
Memnon, should go with his troops from Meroe to Troy, either to
assist his relation, or, at the instigation of some neighbour,
to join in the common defence against the Greek invasion.[56]

In the 11th century before the Christian era, Semiramis, the
celebrated queen of Assyria, fearless of those deserts in which,
according to the fable, she was exposed when an infant, invaded
Ethiopia. Notwithstanding the celebrity of the Assyrian heroine
for cutting through mountains, filling up valleys, and conveying
water, by costly aqueducts, to unfruitful plains and vast deserts,
it does not seem that her success in subduing Ethiopia was very
great. Diodorus only mentions her admiration of a wonderful lake,
160 feet square, of a vermilion colour, which sent forth a delicious
smell, not unlike old wine, and of such wonderful efficacy, that
whoever drank of it acknowledged the sins which he had long since
secretly committed and forgotten. That the kingdom of Meroe was the
part of Ethiopia invaded by her is not improbable. Her mortified
vanity at not having succeeded in her enterprise, the reflections
caused by the dangers and solitudes of the deserts, or the influence
of the religion of Ammon, may have been the monitors that awakened
the guilty conscience of the Assyrian queen.

The next occasion on which we find mention made of an Ethiopian army
is the expedition of Shishak against Jerusalem, in 971 A.C. That
monarch is represented as bringing 1200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen;
and “the people were without number that came with him out of
Egypt; the Lubims, and the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.”[57]
The Ethiopians and Lubims are called a “huge host, with very many
chariots and horsemen.”[58] These Ethiopians may have come from a
district of their country which was subject to Shishak, as we see,
recorded on the monuments at Thebes, not only the invasion of Judea,
mentioned in the Bible, but also victories achieved by that warlike
king over various other nations. It is not, however, improbable that
the Ethiopians were merely assisting the Egyptians. The Sukkiims are
considered by many to be the ancient Troglodytes, the ancestors,
perhaps, of the present Bishareen; there is certainly a curious
resemblance between the name of the present capital of the latter
tribe, Souakim, and their Scripture title, Sukkiim.

Sixteen years only after this event we have an account of another
invasion of the Ethiopians. “So Abijah slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned
in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.” “And
Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah
three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and
drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty
men of valour. And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian,
with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and
came unto Mareshah. Then Asa went out against him, and they set the
battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. And Asa cried
unto the LORD his God.”[59] “So the LORD smote the Ethiopians
before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. And Asa and the
people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians
were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves.”[60]

I conceive that the army of Zerah, like that of Memnon, and those,
perhaps, who assisted Shishak, may have been transported from their
own country, by the navigation of the Red Sea. It has been objected
by some, that Zerah could not have been king of Ethiopia above
Egypt, without being master of the latter country: but not only was
the way by the Red Sea shorter, and much more convenient, but the
kings of Meroe at that time may have possessed a part of Arabia,
and he may thus have marched his army through the peninsula. We may,
however, reasonably suppose, that he would not have undertaken such an
important war against the people of Judah, if he had apprehended any
impediment to his progress, from such near and powerful neighbours as
the Egyptians and Arabians. I see no more reason to doubt that this
Zerah was a king of Meroe, than that Tirhaka was such, who bears the
same title in Scripture, of king of Ethiopia. The monuments of Egypt
and Ethiopia, fortunately, confirm the correctness of the title of
the latter, and show us that Tirhaka, called king of Ethiopia, in the
Bible, was also king of Meroe; but because no vestiges of edifices
constructed by Zerah have survived the almost complete destruction
of Ethiopian monuments, there is no reason why we should conceive
that the Ethiopia of which he is called king is not the same country
which Tirhaka afterwards ruled.

The army of Zerah, which is stated in the Bible at a thousand
thousand, that is, a million of men, may seem enormous; and, perhaps,
this is only a vague expression of an almost innumerable host; but
we must consider, that the tribe of Judah raised an army of 300,000,
and that of Benjamin 280,000, to oppose him. The obligation, still
customary, for every one who could bear arms to join the array of
their king, accounts for the magnitude of their forces. Their duty,
as vassals, would oblige the Ethiopians to join the standards of their
chiefs, and the same cause, joined to the more noble motives of zeal
and devotedness for their country and religion, would draw from their
more peaceful avocations the sons of Judah and Benjamin. The latter
are described as armed with targets, spears, shields, and bows:
such would be precisely the equipment of an army in the centre of
Africa at the present day; but the Ethiopian had also three hundred
chariots, which at once denotes a people to a certain degree advanced
in the art of war. Whatever might be the circumstances which enabled
Zerah to collect together this immense army, we could not have a
more striking proof of the extent and the affluent condition of the
kingdom of Meroe, when we consider that she was able to support
the expense of such a vast and distant expedition, and dispense,
for so long a period, with the services of so many of her sons.

The events hitherto mentioned as connected with the history of Meroe
have been important, as showing her political importance at a very
early period. We have seen her successfully repelling the invasions
of Semiramis, and of her powerful neighbours the Egyptians, and
carrying her arms to the succour of the Trojans, and to attack the
people of Judah.

We come now to that glorious epoch in the annals of Ethiopia, when
her kings reigned not only over their native country, but over the
entire valley of the Nile, including the whole of Egypt. We shall see
that Sennacherib, king of Assyria, felt their power. Their dominion
embraced nations of every variety of colour and character, from
Memphis to the interior of Africa. It is highly satisfactory to know,
that the account of this dynasty of Ethiopian kings who reigned over
Egypt is not only transmitted to us by the joint testimony of sacred
and profane history, but also is amply confirmed by the monuments
of both countries.

The lists of Eusebius and Africanus, extracted from Manetho, agree
perfectly with the names of the three Ethiopian kings who reigned over
Egypt, from 732 to 688 before the Christian era. The following table
shows that they do not exactly correspond, either as to particular
reigns, or the entire length of the dynasty, which Africanus makes
40 years, and Eusebius 44; but the difference is very slight.

Herodotus says[61], that after Asychis, who erected the brick
pyramid, a certain blind man was said to have reigned in the city of
Anysis. During his sway, a large force of Ethiopians, under Sabachus,
their king, invaded Egypt. The blind king escaped by flight into the
mountains, and the Ethiopian reigned in Egypt fifty years. At the
end of that period, according to Herodotus[62], a vision appeared
to Sabachus, commanding him to assemble the priests together,
and destroy them. Rather than be guilty of such a sacrilege, he
preferred returning into his country, particularly as the fifty years,
which the oracle usually consulted by the Ethiopians had stated
to be the term of their sojourn in Egypt, was expired. Diodorus
gives a narrative of this event, agreeing with that of Herodotus,
except that he does not state the name of the king to whom Sabachus
succeeded. He speaks of a king Bucchoris, of a vile appearance, who
exceeded all his predecessors in talent and prudence, and says this
king reigned some time before Sabachus. Both Eusebius and Africanus
agree that Sabachus ascended the throne, after making prisoner a
king called Bocchoris, or Bonchoris. When we consider the loose
accounts which both Herodotus and Diodorus have, in every instance,
given of the Egyptian kings, it is only extraordinary that the time
assigned by them as the duration of the Ethiopian dominion in Egypt
should differ only by six years from that stated by Eusebius. They
have preserved few names of any of the dynasties, and these so
generally differ from Manetho and the monuments, that it is not
surprising to find them describe the Ethiopian dynasty as the reign
of one monarch. We may consider it fortunate that the name of that
king agrees so exactly with the always more correct orthography in
the lists of Eusebius and Africanus. The accuracy, however, of the
list of Eusebius is confirmed by testimony which cannot be disputed,
namely, the evidence of lapidary inscriptions on the monuments of
Egypt and Ethiopia. I will first mention to the reader the names
and titles of those kings, with the places where they were found
recorded; and will afterwards show him that the third king of this
dynasty is the same Tirhaka whose name is connected with one of the
most interesting historical events narrated in the sacred writings.

[Hieroglyphs]

ⲥⲟⲩⲧⲉⲛ (Ⲣⲏ ⲛⲟϥⲣⲉ (ⲛ̀) ⲕⲁ) ⲥⲓⲣⲏ (Ϣⲃⲕ). “The King (Sun Beneficent of
Oblations), Son of the Sun (_Shabak_).” This is undoubtedly the first
of this list of kings. The name is not found upon any of the monuments
of Ethiopia, but that is not surprising, so few of the temples there
being preserved; but we have undoubted evidence of this king having,
as the historians say, reigned over Egypt, for we find his name upon
a gate of the temple of Karnak, and also the portrait of the king in
his Ethiopian dress, with the same titles, on the interior of the
door of the great propylon of the Temple of Luxor, which he repaired.
Signor Rosellini states, that he found a date of the twelfth year
of his reign; which corroborates the statement of Eusebius, that he
reigned twelve years, and not eight only, according to Africanus. I
saw at Berlin a scarabæus containing the name of this king, with the
uræus on each side, and above the oval a lion couchant: the latter is
curious, as it tallies with the singular title I observed above the
names at Amarah, of “King of Kings,” represented by the reed and half
circle, as king (ⲥⲟⲩⲧⲛ), and a lion, emblematical of king, with the
sign of the plural number. Signor Rosellini mentions, also, that this
name is on two amulets he purchased for the Museum at Florence, and
on a statue in the Villa Albani at Rome. I think the latter must be
removed, as I could not find it there, nor do I recollect having seen
any other instance of the name of Sciabak or Sabachus, in the splendid
collections of Egyptian antiquities at Turin, Berlin, Paris, London,
Rome, Naples, Vienna, Munich, &c., except in an inscription on an
alabaster Canopian vase at Paris.

[Hieroglyphs]

ⲥⲟⲩⲧⲛ̀ (Ⲣⲏ.....) ⲡⲓⲕⲁ) ⲥⲓⲣⲏ (Ⲁⲙⲛⲙ (ⲁⲓ) Ϣⲃⲧⲕ), “King (Sun ..... of the
Offerings), Son of the Sun, (the beloved of Amun Shabatok).” This
name is evidently different from the preceding, there being not only
a change in the prænomen, but also in the other oval. Besides the
title of Beloved of Amun, the addition of the third hieroglyphic, the
phonetic sign for T, changes completely the sound. There is as much
difference in the names of Shabako and Shabatok, who therefore are as
clearly two persons, as the Sabbakon and Sevechus of Eusebius. The
Venetian edition of Eusebius calls the latter king Sebichos. When
we consider the remote period, the difference of the dialect, the
errors of copyists, &c., it is not surprising that so much discrepancy
should exist. This name is found on the ruins to the south-east of
the great temple at Carnak; and that the king was an Ethiopian is
evident from his costume. The style is similar to that of Shabak;
but the drawings of Signor Rosellini, which I could have wished to
insert, are clearly the portraits of two different kings. I will
presently state the learned Italian’s reasons for supposing that
both these names allude to the god Seb or Sevek.

ⲥⲟⲩⲧⲛ̀ (Ⲣⲏ-Ⲁⲧⲙⲟⲩⲛⲟϥⲣⲉ, ⲱϥⲉ ⲥⲓⲣⲏ) (Ⲧϩⲣⲕ), “King Sun Atmou beneficent,
Corrector, Son of the Sun (Tirhaka).” The name of this king is found
on the columns and sides of the temple excavated out of the rock at
Gibel el Birkel: it occurs ten times in the inscriptions which I copied
there. It is also on the small altar in the great temple; but Major
Felix[63] appears to me mistaken in supposing that Tirhaka built that
splendid edifice, for his name occurs in that instance only. Whereas
the name of ⲥⲟⲩⲧⲛ̀ Ⲡⲓⲱⲛϩⲉⲓ, “King Pionchei (the living),” is on the
large altar, and also a fragment of it on the western wall of the
temple; but the claim even of the latter may be disputed, for Vignette
A. is the prænomen on the only column which is now standing; and
the name on the pillars is usually that of the king who erected the
edifice. We have the authority, then, of the monuments of Ethiopia,
that Tirhaka was king over that country, and his name, fortunately,
still remains on a pylon of a temple at Medenet Abou, and other places
at Thebes, to corroborate the testimony of Manetho, that he was also
King of Egypt. In the latter instance, his name is written exactly
as I have given it, except that the two last hieroglyphics of the
prænomen are represented, figuratively I conceive, by an arm and a
lash in the hand. I found, also the name of his queen, in the first
chamber excavated out of the temple of Gibel el Birkel (Vignette A).
ⲥⲟⲩⲧⲛ̀-ϩⲓⲙⲉ Ⲁⲙⲛϯⲕϯϩ,, “royal bride, Amentakatah.” Mr. Wilkinson found
two princesses of this family: the first, B, is ⲧⲛⲣ ⲥⲓⲟⲩ, or ⲧ. ⲧⲏⲣ
Ⲁⲙⲛⲁⲧⲥ, “the Divine Star, or the Divine Amenates;” and C, is ⲧⲏⲣ ϩⲓⲙⲉ
ⲦⲙⲁⲩϢⲛⲓⲛⲟϥⲣⲉ, “the Divine Bride, Mutsheninofra, the Mother, Mistress
of Good.” Signor Rosellini states, that there is a date, at Gibel el
Birkel, of the year XX. of this king’s reign, confirming the accuracy
of Eusebius. I did not perceive it, though, I believe, I copied every
hieroglyphic which remains there.

[Hieroglyphs]

The third king of this dynasty is the Tirhaka of Holy Writ: the
narrative there given, is, I conceive, of sufficient importance to
justify my noticing it somewhat in detail.[64]

In the third year of King Hoshea, the son of Elah, king of Israel,
Hezekiah the son of Ahaz began to reign; and, for his zeal in rooting
out the idolatry of his people, he was described as one who “trusted
in the Lord God of Israel, so that after him was none like him among
all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.” Hezekiah
rebelled against the Assyrians, and smote the Philistines; and in
the fourth year of his reign, the king of Assyria, Shalmaneser,
besieged Samaria, and, after three years, took it, and carried away
the Israelites prisoners. In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah,
Sennacherib, who had succeeded to Shalmaneser, went up against
all the “fenced cities of Judah, and took them.” Hezekiah
agreed to purchase a peace for three hundred talents of silver
and thirty talents of gold; and gave to him, for that purpose,
all the treasures in the temples and palaces; but Sennacherib,
faithless to this agreement, sent up a great host against Jerusalem,
and the three chiefs of the army of the king of Assyria, Tartan,
Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh, had a conference with three of the officers
of Hezekiah-Eliakim, who was over the household of Judah, Shebni,
the scribe, and Joab the son of Asaph the recorder. Rabshakeh asked
him, “Now, on whom doest thou trust, that thou rebellest against
me?” and taunted them with trusting upon Egypt. “Now, behold,
thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt,
on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it:
so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.” And he
begged them to give pledges to the King of Assyria, and not trust
on Egypt for chariots or for horsemen. Hezekiah was comforted by
the prophet Isaiah, and Rabshakeh returned and told Sennacherib
that Tirhaka, king of Ethiopia, was coming up to fight against
him. The titles which are given to Tirhaka, in these passages, are
most important. In 2 Kings, xix. 9., he is called king of Ethiopia,
and in xviii. 21. and 24., Pharaoh of Egypt, which is exactly saying
that he was ruler over both countries, as we have seen that Manetho
and the monuments prove him to have been.

This name, according to Signor Rosellini, is written in Hebrew
(תרחקח םלך־כוש) “Tarhaka, Melek Cush,” translated correctly
Θαρακα Βασιλευς Αιθιοπων, “Tarhaka, king of the Ethiopians.” The
perfect resemblance of the name, which neither upon the monuments nor
in the lists is given to any other king of Egypt; the correspondence
of the epoch, and the title of king of Ethiopia, given to a sovereign
of an Ethiopian dynasty, who by force of arms had annexed Egypt to
their paternal kingdom, are circumstances which prove, beyond all
doubt, as the learned Italian[65] says, the identity of the Tarhaka of
the monuments, with the Tirhaka of holy writ. If, according to
Eusebius, we allow 163 years for the 26th dynasty, that is, the one
which succeeded to the Ethiopians in Egypt, that number, added to the
date of the invasion by Cambyses, 525, will make 688, which, added to
the 20 years’ reign of Tirhaka, would make the accession of that king
to the throne to be in 708, nearly the exact time assigned by the
Scripture chronologists for the relief of Hezekiah and Tirhaka; but
Signor Rosellini, principally on the authority of a stela which he
obtained at Alexandria, makes the total of the reigns of that dynasty
150 years, which would cause the accession of Tirhaka to the dominion
of the Nile to happen in 695. Following exactly the chronology of
Scripture, it must have been in the first year of the king’s reign
that the destruction of the Assyrian army took place. “Then the angel
of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred
fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning,
behold, they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib king of Assyria
departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. And it came to
pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that
Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword.”[66]

I will here introduce an event related by Herodotus[67], which,
notwithstanding many discrepancies, is evidently the same:—“After
Sabaco, the Ethiopian, returned into the country, and the blind king
Anysis was dead, there reigned,” he says, “a priest of Vulcan,
named Sethos. This king treated with contempt the warriors of Egypt,
despising them, as if he never would have occasion for them; and,
besides other injuries he committed against them, deprived them of the
ground which, under the preceding kings, had been granted to each,
in portions of twelve fields of a hundred cubits. But afterwards
Sennacherib, king of the Arabs and of the Assyrians, having invaded
Egypt with a great host, none of the warriors were willing to
assist him: then the priest, reduced to extremity, entered into the
sanctuary, bewailed before the figure of the divinity the danger to
which he was exposed. Thus weeping, he fell asleep, and the divinity
appeared unto him in a vision, and exhorted him to take courage,
for he would have nothing to dread in going against the army of the
Arabians, since he himself would send assistance. Animated by this
dream, and having assembled those Egyptians who were willing to follow
him, he fixed his camp in Pelusium, since that city forms the entrance
into the country. He was followed by none of the warriors, but only by
merchants, artificers, and labourers. When they were arrived there,
a multitude of field mice were scattered among their adversaries,
ate the bands of their armour, of their bows and shields, so that,
next day, naked and disarmed, they fled, and many perished.”

This Sethos is evidently the Ethiopian Tirhaka. The latter was the
successor of an Ethiopian, as Sethos is represented to have been,
and it was natural that the Ethiopian should despise the soldiers
of Egypt, whom his predecessor had conquered. His depriving them of
their land, and consequently of their political importance, was the
natural policy of a king who reigned over them by right of conquest;
but, as he was a good and beneficent monarch, who had encouraged
the arts and internal prosperity of the country, of which we have a
proof in his restoring and embellishing the temples, the merchants,
artificers, and labourers hastened to his support, being attached to
his person by the advantages they had derived from his government. The
title of priest is not inappropriate to an Ethiopian king, who was
chosen from that order. Diodorus also informs us how much they were
under the influence of their priests, submitting even to death itself
at their command. Besides the coincidence of the time in the list of
Manetho, there is no mention of a king called Sethos, except the first
of the 19th dynasty, which was long previous. These circumstances
alone almost prove that the Sethos of Herodotus and the Ethiopian
Tirhaka are the same; but we have still stronger evidence. The
king against whom both marched was the same Sennacherib, King of
Assyria, and they are both delivered in the same manner; that is, by
a miracle. Herodotus states Pelusium, not Jerusalem, as the scene of
their discomfiture. This circumstance made me at first imagine that
Sennacherib might have been defeated at both places; but I conceive
it more reasonable to attribute these differences of name, place,
and the nature of the miracle to the usual confusion of Herodotus,
who did not compile his work, like Manetho, from the sacred registers
preserved in the temples, but from verbal communications with the
priests; perhaps the story of the mice was invented by Herodotus,
or his informers, or, at all events, arose in the lapse of time,
to explain the manner in which the Deity interfered in their behalf.

The Tirhaka, then, of the monuments and of Manetho, is the Sethos
of Herodotus, and the Tirhaka who assisted Hezekiah against
Sennacherib. From these various accounts, and by separating, in
the narrative of Herodotus, the probable from the marvellous, we
may conclude that the monarch was pious, since he bore the title
of priest, and applied to the divinity for support before he set
out on the expedition; that he was powerful, since he was not only
able to hold in subjection the entire valley of the Nile, but also
to carry his arms to the assistance of his neighbours. He appears,
also, to have been an enlightened and an able legislator, since he
encouraged the arts; and although a foreigner, had so ingratiated
himself with his people, that, strong in their affections, he was
not only able to destroy the military despotism of the soldiery,
but raise another army, to wage war against the powerful king of
Assyria. Eratosthenes (see Strabo[68],) states that this conqueror
proceeded as far as the Pillars of Hercules.

There is another king mentioned in the Bible, as reigning in Egypt
twelve years before the defeat of Sennacherib. It is agreed, almost
by all, that he is the Shabatok or Sevechus of the lists; but this is
so learnedly and ingeniously discussed by Signor Rosellini, that I
make no apology for enriching this chapter with a translation of his
remarks. At the seventeenth chapter of 2 Kings, it is related that
Shalmaneser, king of the Assyrians, subdued and made tributary Hoshea,
king of Israel. That prince having wished to rebel, and having sent
for aid to So, king of Egypt, Shalmaneser besieged, conquered, and
made him prisoner. The reign of Hoshea over Israel lasted nine years;
so that it appears to have happened in his sixth year, that, to throw
off the Assyrian yoke, he demanded assistance from the king of Egypt.
Therefore, as Shalmaneser besieged and took Samaria in that year, which
was the last of Hoshea, Hezekiah began to reign over Judah in the
third year of Hoshea; and in the 14th year of Hezekiah occurred the
discomfiture of Sennacherib, in which the Pharaoh Tirhaka took part,
as the ally of the king of Judah. The sixth year of Hoshea (in which
he demanded aid of So, king of Egypt,) corresponds to the third year
of the reign of Hezekiah; and since this latter king, in the 14th year
of his reign, made a treaty with Tirhaka, it follows that the Pharaoh,
called So in the Bible, preceded Tirhaka by an interval of not less
than eleven years. But So is called king of Egypt, and Tirhaka was the
same; therefore we ought to seek the Pharaoh So among the kings of
this Ethiopian dynasty. And since he preceded Tirhaka by an interval
of eleven years, we must necessarily recognise him as the immediate
predecessor of Tirhaka, who is called by Manetho Sevechus, or Sebichus,
and, according to Eusebius, reigned twelve years. Not less manifest
than the coincidence of the years is the correspondence of the name
in Manetho and the Bible, if we correct the pronunciation according
to the true sound of the Egyptian language. I have already mentioned,
that the name of Shabatok (so the Sevechus of Manetho is written upon
the monuments) may truly, indeed, be considered as a peculiar word of
the Ethiopian dialect, which corresponds to the Egyptian Sevek. Sevek
is, in the Egyptian mythology, a god, who has attributes relative
to the Nile, and is generally represented under the sacred symbol
of a crocodile. In this form its name is usually written [Symbol] ⲥ
ⲃ ⲕ “Sebek, Sevek;” but when it is represented under a human form,
then it is written simply [Symbol] or [Symbol] ⲥ ⲃ “Seb, Sewe.” The
titles, attributes, and forms of those two names, Sewe and Sebek,
are promiscuous; and we are certain, that, however it is written or
pronounced, it means the same divinity.[69]

Let us take, therefore, from the Hebrew text, the name of the king
of Egypt, to whom Hoshea sent for help. It is written סוא:
disregarding (particularly in a foreign language) the corrupt
pronunciation given to it by Masorete, and the other interpreters,
who read So or Soa, and Sua, let the least learned in the languages of
the East judge, if the natural pronunciation of these Hebrew elements
be not Sewa or Sewe. This is sufficient to show, that the author
of the second book of Kings wrote that name with those characters
which could give the pronunciation of the Egyptian name Sewe. It
is probable that the same name, written upon the monuments in the
Ethiopian manner, Shabatok, was commonly called by the Egyptians,
Sewe; and, perhaps, they pronounced it also, indifferently, Sewek,
since both these words were the designation of the same divinity,
to which that name belongs. In fact, Manetho wrote in his history,
Sevechus, and, cutting off the Greek termination, it remains Sevek,
retaining, from the Ethiopian Shabatok, the pronunciation used in
Egypt. Thus the text of the Bible, also, in relating this Egyptian
name, maintains that possible orthographic exactness which it has
followed in writing all the other Egyptian names. The original
monuments, therefore, and the lists of Manetho concur in attesting
that the dynasty of the Ethiopians was composed of three kings,
whose names I have mentioned, and thus correct the Greek historians
who have assigned it to Sabaco only.

Under the reign of Psammitichus, whom Africanus states to have reigned
twenty-one years, Eusebius thirty-three, and Herodotus fifteen, after
the Ethiopian dynasty, the historian of Halicarnassus informs us
(and his account is confirmed by Diodorus), that 240,000 Egyptian
soldiers were in garrison at Elephantine against the Ethiopians,
at Pelusium against the Arabs and Assyrians, and others, in Marea,
opposite Africa. These soldiers having been three years thus in
garrison, without being relieved, resolved to go over together from
Psammitichus into Ethiopia. Regardless of the entreaties of that king,
they engaged themselves to the king of that country, who employed
them in subduing some of his discontented subjects, whose land he
gave them as a reward. It is added, that the Ethiopians became more
civilised, imbibing the customs of Egypt.

Herodotus states[70], that part of these soldiers were in garrison at
Pelusium, against the Assyrians; probably an attack from that nation
was anticipated, in revenge of the defeat of Sennacherib. According
to that author, there were forty days of land journey, and sixteen
of navigation, between Elephantina and Meroe, besides a space
near Taconso. He says, the distance is the same from there to the
country of the Automali, otherwise called Ascami, a term which means
“Assistants at the left hand of the king;” by which, according to
him, the Egyptian warriors are designated. Whether this last fifty-six
days’ journey extends along the Bahr el Abiad, in the direction of
Axum, or on the Bahr el Azruk, cannot, with certainty, be decided; but
I will presently state my reasons for conceiving the former opinion
to be not improbable. The inhabitants of a part of Ethiopia, at such
an immense distance from the metropolis, would naturally become more
civilised by this Egyptian colony. This passage, at all events,
communicates the highly important fact, that the kingdom of Meroe
reached more than fifty-six days’ journey, both north and south,
from the metropolis; or, in other words, that it was altogether
about 1500 miles in length at that period. This accounts for the
great power of the king of Ethiopia, but for which it is evident,
that a body of 240,000 men would not have been satisfied with having
assigned to them a distant and uncivilised portion of his kingdom,
but would have been easily able to take possession of the whole.

The next important event I shall allude to is the celebrated
expedition of the first king of the Persian dynasty in Egypt.

Cambyses determined to make war upon three different powers,—the
Carthaginians, the Ammonians, and the Egyptian Macrobians. But,
before commencing the expedition into Ethiopia, he resolved to send
spies into the country, and, for this purpose, sent to the island
of Elephantine for some of the Ichthyophagi, who were acquainted
with the Ethiopian language. Cambyses, having instructed these
ambassadors what they should say, gave them, as presents for the
king, a robe of purple, necklaces and bracelets of gold, an alabaster
vase of ointment, and another vase of palm wine. The Ichthyophagi
having arrived, and having been introduced to the king, presented
their offerings, and addressed him thus:—“Cambyses, King of the
Persians, desirous of being your friend and ally, sent us to you
with these gifts, in the use of which he takes great delight.”[71]

The Ethiopian king, knowing well that they came as spies,
answered,—“It is not that the King of the Persians esteems so
much my friendship, that he has sent you to me with gifts; neither do
you speak truly, for you have come to spy out my kingdom. Neither is
he a just man, for if he were just, he would not covet the country
of another, nor wish to make slaves of those who have in no way
offended him. Present to him this bow, and tell him that the King of
the Ethiopians gives this advice to the King of the Persians. When
he is able to manage such large bows with as much facility as I do,
then let him conduct an army against the Egyptian Macrobians, but
one superior to them in number. In the mean time, thank the gods for
not putting it into the mind of the Egyptians to usurp the states
of others.”

Having said this, he unbent the bow, and gave it to them, and having
taken the vest of purple into his hand, he asked them what it was,
and how it was made? The Ichthyophagi having told him the truth
of the purple and the colouring, he said that they were deceivers,
and their garments deceitful. Having inquired about the necklace and
bracelets of gold, and the Ichthyophagi having answered that they
were ornaments, he laughed, conceiving them to be chains, and said,
that he had much stronger ones. Lastly, inquiring of the ointment,
and being shown how it should be worked with the hand, and used,
he said of it the same as he had done of the vest. He then learned
how the wine was made, and its use; and being much pleased with the
trial he made of it, he asked on what things they lived, and what
was the longest period of the life of a Persian? They answered,
that the King lived on bread, explaining to him the nature of corn,
and told him that the space of eighty years was the greatest length
of the life of a Persian. The Ethiopian answered, that he was not
surprised that, subsisting on mud, they should live so few years; that
neither would they live so long, was it not for the wine, and added,
“for in this only are the Persians superior to the Ethiopians.”

The Ichthyophagi having, in their turn, inquired of the King about
his people’s food, and manner of life, he answered, that they lived
on meat and milk; that the greatest part of them lived to the age
of 120 years, and some even longer. The ambassadors having expressed
their surprise at this, the King conducted them to a fountain, after
washing in which they became more vigorous, and shining, as with oil;
and it sent forth an odour as of violet. And the Ichthyophagi said
that this water was so light, that neither wood, nor even lighter
substances, would swim on the surface; but that every thing went to
the bottom; and that the constant use of this water was the reason
why the Ethiopians lived so long.

Cambyses, enraged at this reception of the Ethiopians, set out
without preparing any store of provisions, and without reflecting
that it was the extremity of the world to which he was carrying
his arms. Before he had marched a fifth part of the route from
Thebes, the want of provisions was felt; yet he madly determined to
proceed. The soldiers fed on grass as long as any could be found;
at length, when they arrived in the deserts, they were obliged to
cast lots, to eat one in ten; which finally induced Cambyses to
return to Thebes with the remains of his army.—The defeat of this
monarch is also mentioned by Diodorus.

If this account be at all correct, the country of the Macrobians must
have been at some distance from Meroe, otherwise they could not have
been ignorant of the use of necklaces and bracelets, since the figures
on the walls of the sepulchres of that metropolis are represented with
those ornaments. The fountain mentioned by the Ichthyophagi is almost
as wonderful as the lake which Diodorus reports as seen by Semiramis;
but, discarding what bears the stamp of fiction in this narrative, we
can easily recognise, in this account of the Macrobians, a powerful
nomad tribe, in possession of the gold country which was the great
attraction to Cambyses. Their degree of strength and longevity,
probably exaggerated, might be gained by the habits of frugality and
temperance usual among the nomad tribes. Their food (meat and milk)
is exactly that of the Bishareen and other tribes of the desert at
the present day. Their not understanding the nature of the ointment,
may have been from its being very superior to their own; all that is
probable in the description of the fountain is, that it consisted of
oil. The Arab tribes are now in the habit of anointing their bodies,
conceiving this custom to be in the highest degree salubrious, and
indeed necessary, to mitigate the parching effects of a vertical sun
and the hot winds of the desert. I tried this custom, and found it
very beneficial; and am persuaded I should have suffered less from
the heat had I used it more frequently; but the smell of the ointment
they now use is not like the violet, as the Ichthyophagi describe
that of the Macrobians. It is not, therefore, surprising that a
powerful tribe, doubtless less barbarous than at the present day,
being in connection with states then more civilised, should have a
bath of prepared oil, suited to the pressing wants of the country. A
nomad tribe might, very probably, be ignorant how the purple colour
was produced; for, with the exception of some shawls worn by the
chiefs, none of the Arabs of the present day use any thing but
white cotton and linen cloths. The Melek Nazr e’ Deen (see Plate
III.), is almost the only exception I have met with. Sheakh Sayd,
the chief of all the Ababdes, did not know how the indigo plant
(which his country produces) was made into a dye, till he went with
me through the manufactory at Berber. I suspect that the account of
their contempt for gold, is an embellishment of the Greek historian,
or an exaggeration of the ambassadors; for they must have learnt
its value by exchanging it with their more civilised neighbours. It
is not, however, impossible that they may have used it for chains,
as they might not have possessed other metals, or if they did, might
not have had skill to work them into chains so easily as they could
gold; or, from their greater rarity, they might have been equally
as valuable.[72]

Herodotus calls them Egyptian Macrobians, and afterwards Egyptians. I
am almost inclined to believe that they may have been a nomad race,
blended with the 240,000 soldiers, who, according to Herodotus,
deserted from Psammitichus, and had a territory assigned to them,
among a people about sixty days’ journey distant from Meroe. It
is certain that the Egyptians would marry native wives. They might,
as Herodotus says, have improved the manners of the people; but,
being warriors, and not mechanics or artificers, and accustomed
to a rigid distinction of castes, they might not have introduced
a knowledge of the arts, and even what they taught might, in a
century and a half, be forgotten by a tribe whose habits would
give them little taste for such acquirements. I cannot agree with
those who consider the country of the Macrobians to be on or near
the Arabian Gulf, in the territory of the present Soumalies, or,
as Professor Heeren[73] has placed them, beyond Cape Guardefui;
for, mad as Cambyses is represented to have been, he surely could
not have been so infatuated as to have attempted to penetrate to so
vast a distance, across the immense deserts and inhospitable regions
of the interior, the whole population of which would be hostile to
his progress, particularly when a far shorter and easier way was
open to him by the Arabian Gulf and the Straits of Babelmandel. It
may be stated that the Persians were, perhaps, unskilled and averse
to navigation; but even if not navigators themselves, they might
easily have procured transports. I think the Macrobians should be
placed more in the interior; probably on the Bahr el Abiad. Pausanias
(lib. iv.) says, that Meroe and the Ethiopian plains are inhabited by
the Macrobians, the most just people of the earth: but that they have
not in the country any sea, nor any other river but the Nile. This
statement, which merits attention, being from one so deeply versed in
Egyptian subjects, proves what I have stated,—that the Macrobians
did not occupy the territory of the present Soumalies, near the sea;
but at the same time brings them nearer to Meroe than we can admit
from their state of civilisation, or the testimony of Herodotus,
who describes them as being on the southern side of Africa.

I have now to mention an historical fact, connected with some curious
Ethiopian customs, which might have been rejected as a fable, but
for the evidence of a lapidary inscription, which records the name of
the king connected with it. This gives to it an authentic character,
and affords another proof of the general accuracy of the Sicilian
historian’s account of the Ethiopians.

“The Ethiopians,” says Diodorus[74], “have many laws differing
from those of other nations, particularly as regards the choice of
their kings. The priests choose the most respectable of their order,
and form them into a circle; and he who by chance is taken hold of
by the priest, who enters into the circle, walking and leaping like
a satyr, is declared king upon the spot; and all the people worship
him, as a man charged with the government by Divine Providence. The
king lives after the manner prescribed to him by the law. In all
things he follows the customs of the country, neither punishing nor
recompensing but according to the laws established since the origin
of the nation. It is not permitted to the king to cause any of
his subjects to be executed, even when they shall have been judged
worthy of death; but he sends to the guilty person an officer, who
carries to him the signal of death; and immediately the criminal
shuts himself in his house, and executes justice on himself. It is
not permitted to him to fly into a neighbouring kingdom, and change
the pain of death into banishment, as they do in Greece. They relate
that a certain man, having received an order of death, which had
been sent to him by the king, thought of flying out of Ethiopia. His
mother, who suspected his design, passed her girdle around his neck,
without his attempting to defend himself, and strangled him, lest,
as she said, her son should bring increased disgrace upon his family
by his flight.”

We perceive, by these passages, that the Ethiopians had regular laws,
to which not only the people but the king submitted. The kings,
it seems, were chosen from the priests, and therefore it is not
extraordinary that they were so completely under their power as
we shall shortly see; for probably, like the cardinals at Rome,
they did not select always the most talented, but often the most
manageable, as their chief. The satyr-like gambols of the priest,
which were the cause of his being elected, remind me somewhat of
the impositions, or, rather, workings of the spirit, which the Arab
fakeers and sheakhs sometimes exhibit.[75]

[Hieroglyphs]

“The death of the kings,” says Diodorus, “is still more extraordinary.
The priests at Meroe have acquired great power. When they form the
resolution, they send a courier to the king, with an order for him to
die. They tell him that the gods (or oracles) had thus decreed, and
that he would be guilty of a crime if he violated an order from them.
They added many other reasons, which would easily influence a simple
man, aware of the ancient custom, and who had not strength of mind
sufficient to resist such an unjust command. The first kings submitted
to this cruel sentence. Ergamenes, who reigned at the time of the
second Ptolemy, and who was instructed in the philosophy of Greece, was
the first who dared to throw off this ridiculous yoke. He went with his
army to the place difficult to get to, or (εἰς τὸ ἄβατον) fortress,
where was formerly the temple of gold of the Ethiopians, and caused all
the priests to be massacred, and instituted himself a new religion.”
Signor Rosellini found the name of this king on the door of the
sanctuary of Dacker. ⲥⲟⲩⲧⲛ̀ (Ⲁⲙⲛⲧⲟⲧ ⲱⲛϩ, Ⲣⲏ-ⲱⲧⲡ) ⲥⲓⲣⲏ (Ⲉⲣⲕⲁⲙⲛ ⲱⲛϩ ϫⲧⲧ,
Ⲓⲥⲏⲙⲁⲓ). “King Amentot (hand of Amun), the living, devoted to Phre (Son
of the Sun), Erkamon, always living, beloved of Isis.”—Vol. ii. 321.

The discovery of the name is of the greatest importance; as the
evidence of this lapidary inscription, that there was a king called
Ergamenes, or, to give him his proper name, Erkamenes, is strongly
corroborative of the whole narrative of Diodorus. He could not have
been an Egyptian king, for there is no mention in any of the lists
of a king of that name. We may, therefore, with certainty conclude,
that it is the Ethiopian monarch Erkamenes. Philæ was generally
considered the boundary of Egypt, but we have the indubitable
testimony of a long train of splendid monuments, from that island to
Solib, that the rulers of Egypt, from the Pharaohs of the eighteenth
dynasty until the time of the Cæsars, possessed at all events,
at different intervals, that part of Ethiopia.

From there being there no Ethiopian edifices, but all Egyptian
temples, from the first to the second cataract, it is probable that
the Egyptians were generally in possession of that part of the valley
of the Nile; but the name of this Ethiopian king having been found
on this Ptolemaic edifice, can only be accounted for by his having
been in possession of the country. The style of the architecture
and sculpture of the temple of Dacker is certainly like that of the
Ptolemies. I therefore do not conceive that the temple was built by
Erkamenes, but perhaps that conqueror celebrated his victories by
religious functions, a representation of which he had sculptured on
the temple at the limit of his conquests.

[Hieroglyphs]

Besides Erkamenes, we have accounts of another Ethiopian monarch,
whose name Signor Rosellini found on the temple of Deboud, in Lower
Nubia, and which he conceives (I think very correctly), to be also of
an Ethiopian king of about the same period. ⲥⲟⲩⲧⲛ̀ (Ⲣⲏ ⲛ̀ ⲱⲧⲡ, ⲥⲱⲧⲛ̀
ⲛ̀ⲛⲓⲧⲏⲣ) ⲥⲓⲣⲏ (Ⲁⲧⲣⲣⲁⲙⲛ, ⲱⲡϩ ϫⲧⲧ) “King (Son of Perfection, approved by
the gods), Son of the Sun (Atarramon, always living.)” This, therefore,
is an Ethiopian king, whose conquests extended to within a few miles of
Philæ.

A Greek inscription at Kalabshy mentions the victories of Silco,
king of all the Ethiopians, over the Blemmyes. No other Ethiopian
names are found in Lower Nubia, except some prisoners represented
on the walls of the temple of Rameses at Kalabshy.

Strabo[76] gives us a highly important narrative of an event that
took place in his time. It is peculiarly interesting, as it accounts
for the ruin of the towns and temples which once adorned that part
of the valley of the Nile. “The Ethiopians,” says he, “taking
advantage of Ælius Gallus having taken away the garrison of Syene,
to prosecute his expedition into Arabia, by a sudden and unforeseen
attack took possession of Syene, Elephanta, and Philæ; made the
inhabitants prisoners, overthrew the statues of Cæsar Augustus;
but Petronius, with 10,000 foot and 800 cavalry, attacked their
army, composed of 30,000 men, and forced them to fly to Pselchis,
an Ethiopian city: he sent ambassadors to them there, to demand
what they had taken, and to know what reason they had to complain of
the governors. They required three days to consider, and as, after
that time, Petronius did not obtain satisfaction, he attacked them,
forced them to give battle, and had no difficulty in putting to
flight men ill disciplined and ill armed, having only large shields
of unmanufactured ox-hide, hatchets, spears, and sabres. Some threw
themselves into the town, others fled into the desert. Some gained
a neighbouring town by swimming across the river; among the number
were the generals of Candace, who reigned over the Ethiopians. This
queen, whose courage was beyond her sex, was deprived of one eye.

“Petronius crossed the river upon rafts and boats, and made
prisoners all those who were in the island, and sent them immediately
to Alexandria; afterwards they attacked Pselchis, and took it by
assault. From Pselchis, Petronius, crossing the downs of sand
where the army of Cambyses had been swallowed up by the winds,
reached Premnis, a town in a strong situation, gained it at the
first attack, and advanced afterwards on Napata, the capital of
the kingdom of Candace, where her son was then residing. Candace
occupied a neighbouring place, whence she sent to demand peace,
offering to restore the prisoners who had been brought from Syene,
and the statues which they had carried off; but Petronius, regardless
of these propositions, attacked Napata, which the queen and her son
had abandoned, razed the town, and led away the inhabitants captive.

“He returned with his booty, judging the road beyond to be too
difficult. He took, however, the precaution to fortify Premnis
better, leaving there a garrison of 400 men, with provisions for two
years. Candace advanced, with a considerable force, against Premnis,
but Petronius came to its relief, and succeeded in throwing himself
into the town before the arrival of the queen, and provided various
means of defence for the safety of the place. Candace sent ambassadors
to Petronius, who ordered them to go to Cæsar (Augustus); and as
they pretended not to know who Cæsar was, and which way they must
go, he gave them an escort. These ambassadors arrived at Samos,
where Cæsar then was. He granted all that they desired, and even
freed them from the tribute which he had imposed upon them.”

We perceive from this account the superiority of the Roman
arms. The discipline of those celebrated troops would have made
them irresistible, whatever might have been the inferiority of
their number, against such wretched soldiers as Strabo represents
the Ethiopians: but Petronius, when at Napata, would scarcely have
refrained from proceeding to Meroe, nor eventually would he have
shut himself up in Premnis, whatever might have been the force of
Candace, had it consisted of the undisciplined, ill-armed people
he describes. Augustus does not seem to have despised them, since
he concluded a peace on their own terms. In my account of the arts
of Meroe, I will mention the probable effects of this destructive
invasion of Petronius. Pliny also mentions this expedition[77], and
states that, after Pselchis and Premnis, he took also the cities of
Aboccis, Phthuris, Cambusis, Attenan, and Stadisis, and afterwards
Napata; but he adds, it was not only the Roman arms which made
a wilderness of this part of Ethiopia, but the wars with Egypt,
alternately ruling over, and subject to, that country.

The year of the expedition of Petronius has never been exactly
ascertained[78], but according to Dion Cassius (lxiv. s. 7.),
Augustus went into the East in the year of Rome 734. Therefore,
as the ambassadors of the Ethiopians found him at Samos, on his way
into Syria, the expedition of Petronius can only have taken place
a very short time before that period, that is, about twenty years
before Christ.

An event of the greatest importance is recorded in the Gospel, as
having taken place A.D. 33. An eunuch, a man of great authority under
Candace, who had the charge of all her treasure, was converted by
Philip.[79] The time at which Philip met the eunuch was subsequent to
that of Ergamenes, when, as we have seen, a taste for Greek literature
was spread in Ethiopia; therefore, the Greek language was, without
doubt, sufficiently known to enable them to read the Old Testament,
which was then translated into that language. It is not extraordinary,
that a man who may be supposed to have raised himself to his high
station of chief eunuch, by superior talent, should have perceived
the superiority of the Jewish religion to that of Amun, nor is it
unreasonable to presume that many of the Jews visited Ethiopia, and
contributed to his conversion. We find him, therefore, as a believer
in the Jewish religion, undertaking a journey of nearly 2000 miles
to worship at the holy temple of Jerusalem, and engaged, when Philip
met him, in studying the promises held out to the chosen people. We
have no reason, I think, to assume that, because the sacred writings
have only recorded this solitary instance, there were not other
Ethiopians who had embraced the Jewish religion. It is well known
that, in the East, through every age, the chief eunuch has always
been one of the most powerful officers at the court; and it is not
unreasonable, I think, to presume that his influence, joined to the
persuasive truth of the doctrines of Christianity, may have induced
many to forsake the ancient worship of the country, which had then,
perhaps, degenerated, as in Egypt, into gross polytheism. Unless we
assign a reign of more than fifty years to the Candace of the Gospel,
she cannot be the sovereign who reigned at the time of the expedition
of Petronius; but Pliny informs us that several queens who reigned in
Ethiopia assumed this appellation. Philip met the eunuch, riding in
his chariot, on the road from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is a desert
tract. Those deserts, which the traveller is now obliged to cross
on the fatiguing camel, exposed to the hot sun and parching winds,
the eunuch, it seems, rode over comfortably in his chariot. About
the year 330, when Athanasius was Patriarch of Alexandria, according
to Ludolf[80], Christianity was introduced into Abyssinia, by two
youths, Frumentius and Ædisius, who were shipwrecked on the coast
of the Red Sea; but it was not until the time of Theodosius that
the Nubians were converted; and, according to the Arab writer,
Sheref el Edrese, A.D. 1153, they were still Christians.

I shall not attempt the laborious, and almost useless, task, of
endeavouring to trace the history of this country from the time of
the Romans until the present day. My object has been to lay before
the reader the most important fragments of history connected with
the kingdom of Meroe. The capital of Candace was Napata, and not
Meroe. The latter celebrated metropolis seems to have existed
until the age of Ptolemy Philadelphus; and at the time of Nero,
Pliny describes Napata as of no importance. _Oppidum id parvum
inter prædicta solum_. After this sad decline of the glory of the
Ethiopians, we find the wild tribes, whose power was formerly absorbed
in the superior greatness of Meroe, now acting the principal part. The
wars of the Blemmyes and the Nubians with each other, and against the
Roman power, are the most important events afterwards transmitted to
us; but, as these tribes have left no monuments of their civilisation,
their names, victories, and defeats, have little connection with the
history of Meroe. It might be interesting to trace the wasting away
of that lamp of civilisation which had shone once so bright; but such
an inquiry would exceed my limits, as well as the object prescribed to
myself, which was, to show the once great political importance of the
Ethiopians of Meroe. I have said, in my topographical description,
that my examination of the existing monuments led me to adopt the
opinion of those who believe the statement of Diodorus, that Meroe
was the cradle of the arts. I shall, in the following chapters,
bring forward additional arguments to prove that statement. The
establishment of this fact will give an additional interest to that
classical land, which we have seen to be the country of Memnon, Zerah,
Tirhaka, Ergamenes, &c., and against which the efforts of Semiramis,
Cambyses, and the Egyptian Pharaohs[81], were vainly directed.

_Commerce of Meroe._—The history of nations, and particularly of
cities, clearly evinces the extraordinary effects of commerce. Those
countries which have attained to any high degree of power and
prosperity have been, in a great measure, indebted for them to that
source of wealth. A wise government, anxious for the welfare of its
subjects, always affords the utmost encouragement and protection to
commerce, guarding it against those accidents which endanger its
security, and when, from unavoidable circumstances, one branch is
closed, seeks to open other channels to its successful activity. In
order that a state may carry on extensive commerce, it ought to
possess an advantageous position, contiguous to other rich countries,
with the opportunity of becoming an emporium for their commodities,
and of supplying them with those in which they are deficient. She
ought also to enjoy abundant internal resources, derived from
agriculture, manufactures, and mines.

A slight examination of the map of this part of Africa will satisfy us
that there could not have been a situation, on that immense continent,
more admirably adapted for commercial intercourse than Meroe. Placed
at a short distance only from the conflux of the Astaboras and the
Nile, she was connected, by the former, with that part of Ethiopia
now called Abyssinia; and, by the latter, now denominated the Bahr el
Azruk, or Blue River, with the provinces of Sennaar, Fazoukl, and,
perhaps, with regions still further to the south. It is also highly
probable that, by the Bahr el Abiad, or White River, the true Nile,
she communicated extensively with vast districts in the interior
of Africa. The distance from these rivers, particularly from the
Astaboras, to the present ports of Massoua (the ancient Adule)
and Souakim, on the Red Sea, whence she received, perhaps, the
productions of Arabia and the Indies, was by no means great. Nature
seems to have facilitated the intercourse by providing her with the
ship of the desert—the camel. By its means, probably, the commerce
of Meroe may have been widely diffused into the centre of Africa;
to the countries now called Kordofan and Darfour, which are only at
a short distance from the Nile; nor is it improbable that a powerful
and enterprising nation, such as the Ethiopians then appear to have
been, may have extended their caravan trade to the kingdoms of Soudan,
Bornou, &c., and possibly even to the now impervious Timbuctoo.

It may be asked, if the profit which the merchants of Meroe could
derive from such distant expeditions would repay the cost and hazard;
but an examination of the expense of transporting merchandise on
camels will remove that objection. In the estimate which I am about
to make, of the expenses of sea and land carriage, the rates must,
of course, be those of the present day; this, however, will be to the
disadvantage of my argument, as navigation, at that remote period,
was in a much more imperfect state, and consequently more tedious and
expensive, than it now is. I shall select wool, as a bulky article,
and, therefore, more difficult to transport by land. I shall suppose
a vessel, laden with 1000 bags of wool, of 450 lbs. each, and that
its average passage was thirty days, for which the owners received a
freight of 1_d._ per lb., which, I believe, is about the usual rate
for a voyage of that length. Supposing, also, that the average sailing
of the vessel, allowing for detentions from contrary winds, and for
the time occupied in loading and reloading, be fifty miles per day,
making thus 1500 miles. Now, the usual load for a camel is 500 lbs.,
sometimes 600 lbs., so that 450 lbs. is a very moderate calculation;
and at the rate the merchandise of the Pasha is now carried down to
Cairo, not more than sixty days would be necessary to accomplish the
above distance. They charged me eighteen shillings for twenty days,
averaging about twenty-five miles per day; therefore the expense
of the sixty days, at present, would not exceed two pounds fourteen
shillings; about sixteen shillings more than by water.

In ancient times the expense of labour and camels was not likely
to differ materially from what it now is; but that of maritime
conveyance must have been much larger. We know the number of men that
were necessary to impel the boats, and their system of following all
the sinuosities of the coasts. Hence the time taken to accomplish a
voyage of any extent must have been very long. The period required
by Solomon’s vessels to reach the country of Ophir is a proof of
the dilatory, and consequently expensive, navigation in that age. As
I have stated in my account of Dongolah, 2500 loads of gum, of 450
rotols each, are carried down to Cairo, that is, a distance of about
1800 miles, for 2_l._, including all expenses; being thirteen per
cent. on the value.

This calculation proves, that the cost of land carriage, particularly
for the short journeys to the Red Sea, Kordofan, and Darfour, would
be only a slight inconvenience; and even the expense of a regular
trade to Fezzan and Bornou, by the route which the Mamelukes took,
would have been no very heavy burden on the articles. That on which
I have chosen to make this calculation, was, as already observed, one
of the most disadvantageous that could have been selected. The expense
of 18_s._ (and I, as a traveller, of course paid the highest price),
on conveying, for a journey of twenty days, 500 pounds weight of rich
Indian stuffs, or of Arabian spices, must have been quite trifling.

Meroe, therefore, enjoyed the advantage, not only of a direct
water communication by the Nile, Bahr el Abiad, Bahr el Azruk,
and the Astoboras, to an extent of several thousand miles of the
vast continent of Africa, but also, by means of the ship of the
desert, had an intercourse with her ports on the Red Sea, and could
thence open a communication with Arabia, and through it, perhaps,
with India. Thus, also, she could exchange her merchandise or the
rich natural productions of the centre of Africa. The circumstance
mentioned in my topographical description (page 200.), that in
the reign of the fourth caliph after Mahomet, this country was
overrun by a powerful tribe from Yemen, and not from the Hedjas,
as was generally supposed, renders it very probable, that that part
of Arabia in particular had been deeply engaged in the commerce of
Meroe. The knowledge thus obtained of its former wealth and power,
its then entirely decayed condition, and the facilities afforded by
its ports to invaders, were likely to induce a nation, then in full
power, and inflamed by religious zeal, to invade and lay waste that
country to which it was formerly, perhaps, tributary, or even subject.

A glance at the map is sufficient to show, that the commerce of the
Indies must have been much more easily carried on with Meroe than
with Egypt; for, whether the Ethiopians navigated directly to India,
or received the produce of that rich country, by the caravans and
vessels of the Arabians; in either case, she possessed superior
local advantages over Egypt. Her ports on the Red Sea were better,
the distance far shorter, and the dangerous navigation of that sea
in a great measure avoided.

Adule, supposed, by some, to be near the present Arkeko, latitude 15°
30′ N., is called, by Pliny (vi. 29.) the very great emporium of
the Troglodytes and the Ethiopians, and the commerce chiefly consisted
in ivory, horns of the rhinoceros, hides of the hippopotamus, shells
of the tortoise, sphinxes, and slaves.[82] According to Bruce, there
are, at the entrance of the Arabian Gulf, the ruins of a place, from
which, to Arabia Felix, the passage only requires a few hours. The
direct commerce with Arabia, and sale of her manufactures in that
populous peninsula, must also have been very great; but the commerce
of Africa was, doubtless, the principal source of the power of Meroe.

The superfluity of gold, which Herodotus (in his account of the
Ichthyophagi sent as ambassadors, or rather spies, by Cambyses to
the king of Ethiopia), describes as being applied to such common
purposes, that even the prisoners were bound in chains of that metal,
may, perhaps, have been a Greek mode of hyperbolically expressing
its great abundance. I believe the supply of this metal to have
been drawn chiefly from the interior. Diodorus says (lib. i. 29.),
and Strabo repeats the passage, without acknowledging his author,
“that island contains mines of gold, silver, iron, copper, and
great abundance of ebony, and various kinds of precious stone,
και μέταλλα χρυσου τε και αργύρου, &c., but the search of the Pasha
after them has been fruitless. She may have derived a certain portion
from mines in her own territories, and even in the island, which are
now exhausted; but, from the limited traces of such mines hitherto
discovered, I conceive it more probable that she obtained that
abundance of the precious metals, not only from the now exhausted
mines in the Great Nubian desert[83] (see pages 23. and 28.), but
principally from the centre or the south of Africa. The Turkish
governors now, when they make their expeditions into the Habeesh and
the negro countries, frequently amass an immense quantity of gold; it
is said, as much as 2000 or 3000 ounces; and before the conquest of
the Pasha, I am informed that every peasant girl wore gold ornaments
to a large amount. The inhabitants of the countries south of Sennaar
are described to me as still possessing great abundance of gold, which
must, in fact, be the case, for many merchants have told me that there
is always plenty in the markets.

The exclusive commerce which Meroe must have long enjoyed with so
considerable a portion of that vast continent, was quite sufficient
to raise her to a great height of opulence. The countries of the
interior, if not really conquered by her, would, at all events,
gladly exchange their gold, and other natural productions, for
her manufactures and merchandise, which, doubtless, far exceeded
in quality what they made themselves, or could procure elsewhere,
being the production of a people more advanced in civilisation and
the arts; while they, isolated by immense deserts from the rest of
the world, would be little visited, except by the caravans from the
metropolis. Gold was, probably, not the only return these countries
afforded to Meroe. Brown has given an account of the productions
of Darfour, and, as I have said before, 2500 camel loads of gum are
sent yearly from Kordofan to Cairo. Iron mines have been found both
in Kordofan and Darfour. I have specimens of this metal from the
latter country, which is current in the bazaars, like money.[84]
I may here remark, that, not improbably, the Ethiopian stone,
mentioned by Herodotus as employed to make incisions in the bodies,
for the purpose of embalming and forming them into mummies, was iron
procured from that country by the Egyptians, who had no mines of their
own. Ivory is still found abundantly in Abyssinia, and also in the
province of Fazoukl; and elephants are always found in the territory
of the Bugara tribe, behind Kordofan. Probably Meroe received many
other commodities, with which an imperfect knowledge of those remote
regions prevents us from being acquainted; besides others, perhaps,
which are no longer produced.

Herodotus (Thalia, 97.) says,—“The Ethiopians on the confines of Egypt,
whom Cambyses subdued in his expedition, and those who inhabit the
sacred island of Nysa, celebrate festivals to Bacchus. These Ethiopians
and their neighbours bring, according to my memory, two half measures
of pure gold, two hundred (φάλαγγας) long round pieces of ebony, five
Ethiopian children, and twenty-large elephants’ teeth.” This passage
reminds me of that magnificent procession in a tomb at Thebes, of the
time of Thothmes III. Fifty figures are represented, exclusive of the
Egyptians, painted red; six are black, and four of a dark brown, but
apparently of the same country. These people, not having the Egyptian
dress, are doubtless Ethiopian, and most of them are so called by the
hieroglyphics. The splendid presents which they are presenting to the
royal owner of the tomb, almost exactly correspond with the account
just quoted from Herodotus.

They consist of ivory, ebony, a most beautiful collection of vases,
and a variety of animals,—horses, cows, the giraffe, capricorn,
leopards, cynocephali, greyhounds, &c. Among a gorgeous pile of
offerings appear heaps of gold and silver, skins, precious wood,
and indigo. In the same procession are also thirty-seven white
people, with very nearly the features of Jews, although many, from
the hieroglyphics, consider them to be Scythians. Some of the latter
are leading a chariot and horses, an elephant, young children, and one
of them a bear; they are also carrying a variety of elegant vases. I
conceive these presents, with the exception, perhaps, of the bear,
to be chiefly from Ethiopia, and from the richness and elegance of the
form of the vases, the abundance of gold and silver, and the curious
manner in which the latter is wrought into the form of the heads of
animals, we have the very strongest proofs of the exquisite taste,
knowledge, and wealth of the Ethiopians: but as this procession is so
extremely interesting, so intimately connected with Ethiopia, and is,
at the same time, one of the most gorgeous and magnificent paintings
that adorn the walls of Thebes, I have selected it from my Egyptian
portfolio, conceiving that it will give great additional value to
this work to publish it with all the colours, which still exist,
almost quite fresh. The hieroglyphics are unfortunately very much
defaced, but sufficient remain to distinguish in several instances
the names of the people and that of the King, Thothmes III., who
reigned about 1500 B.C.

Parts I. II. III. and IV. form the whole of this procession; they
are drawn to a scale of two inches to a foot, so that the reader
may join them together, if he thinks proper. I will give a detailed
description of them according to the plates. The first figure in Part
I. has in one hand an ornamented vase, containing perhaps dates or
some other dried fruit, in the other, apparently, an ivory club, and
a string of precious stones hanging from his arm. The second figure
has a couple of feathers in one hand, which are evidently those of
the ostrich, from the circumstance of the vase he carries in the
other containing the eggs. The third and fourth in this row bear a
tree. The fifth carries a bowl, apparently of dates, in one hand,
and in the other a couple of ostrich feathers, and a cord to which
a leopard is attached. The sixth man has a gold or gilded vase in
his hand, and has also charge of a monkey. The seventh bears a log
of ebony on his shoulder, and is also leading a capricorn, an animal
which abounds near Mount Sinai, and also, I believe, in the Bahiouda
desert. The eighth has a log of ebony on his shoulder. The ninth,
tenth, and last, are negroes, which may be distinguished from their
colour and features. They have blue skull caps[85] and cinctures,
with blue and red borders around their waists. The two last are
carrying elephants’ teeth, and one of them has a string of precious
stones, and the other the skin of a leopard turned inside out. The
other negro is carrying a log of ebony, and, as will be observed,
the light-coloured veins in that wood are distinctly marked.

_Printed in Colours by C. Hullmandel._]

The second row of figures in this plate are still more curious. They
are called Ethiopians. The cinctures and boots of each individual
are of a different pattern, rivalling in variety and elegance the
chintz morning dresses of our modern belles. These Ethiopians have
their hair dressed in curls above their foreheads, and ringlets
hanging down on their shoulders. The first is carrying a piece of
an elephant’s tooth and a vase in his hand; the others, eleven
in number, are bearing elegant descriptions of vases, apparently
of gold and silver; these, although unadorned with figures and
mythological subjects, are most exquisite in form, and I am sure
the reader will admit their decorations to be most beautiful. Those
carried by the third, fifth, and tenth figures of the second row of
this plate, apparently contain flowers; whether these are artificial
decorations of the vases, or really represent plants,—varieties,
perhaps, of the lotus peculiar to Ethiopia—is a question I cannot
decide. The necklaces which the third figure is bearing are very
elegant, apparently of lapis lazuli and gold. The elegant vase the
seventh figure is carrying, is either of ivory or silver.

The third row in this plate contains a most interesting group of
Ethiopians. The first figure, bearing a log of ebony and a monkey
on his shoulder, is conducting a drove of seven oxen. I might have
taken the liberty to restore the forms of the latter; but, as will be
seen by the plate, the heads and fore-legs only are still remaining,
showing the curious and beautiful manner in which the Egyptians
grouped their cattle. Above the oxen is a curious group of dogs, not
very unlike the greyhounds that at present exist in Ethiopia. The
next group is very interesting; two Ethiopians are conducting a
giraffe, admirably drawn. A mischievous monkey is climbing up its
neck. The way in which he is conducted, with cords attached to his
feet, is curious, and the cincture of the Ethiopians leading him
is formed apparently of the skin of a giraffe, they being, perhaps,
inhabitants of the deserts where the animal is found. The next, or
fourth figure, is leading a monkey, and bearing a vase full of ostrich
eggs and feathers. The fifth figure is a negro, carrying a tooth
of an elephant and skins; he has a blue cap. I do not believe that
such caps were then worn, but that their hair is represented blue,
to distinguish it from the colour of their faces, which was black;
otherwise, from the same colours joining, it would have appeared as
if they wore no hair at all. The Egyptian border is a great finish to
the painting. The broad blue streak above the top-line represents the
heavens. The ground colour, which is exactly the tint of the original,
adds to the richness of the painting, and throws out the white.

Part II. is a continuation of the three rows last described. The four
figures in the top row are dark-coloured, but not quite black. This
is one of the very few instances in which the Egyptians preserved
any degree of difference between the usual red colour and the black
of the negroes. The pile of gorgeous offerings in the centre of this
plate is magnificent; the first row contains two obelisks, perhaps
of granite, beautifully decorated vases containing rings, which,
from the hieroglyphics, we find are of gold, sealed bags of the same,
and precious stones, and heaps of grain, and apparently fruit. The
second row contains still richer offerings: in the first line are two
very prettily decorated vases, laden with ingots of silver, and an
elegant tray, on which are rings, which, from their hieroglyphics,
must be also of silver; and another vase, containing, I think,
indigo. The second line comprises some very elegant vases, apparently
of gold and silver, and one blue glass bottle: the streaks of yellow
in the latter are curious. The third line includes beautifully-shaped
vases, which, from the hieroglyphics, are either full of silver and
gold, or actually made of those precious metals; and, what is very
remarkable in this line, there are several heads of animals, which,
from the hieroglyphics, and also from the colouring, are evidently of
silver and gold. There is the head of a capricorn, in gold; one of an
antelope, and another of a jackall, in silver; and one of a leopard,
and of a curious description of bird, apparently a cock, in gold.

The third row is equally rich. In the first line there are rings of
gold, and bags, which the reader will remark in the plate, are also
sealed; ostrich feathers, logs of ebony, and a cynocephalus, perched
comically in the centre. The lower line contains elephants’ teeth,
a beautiful skin of a leopard, ingots and rings of gold, and sealed
bags of precious stones. At the end of each row is a scribe, writing
in his book with his pen an inventory of the different offerings;
behind the latter are gentlemen, perhaps of the household of the king,
with their white wands of office. All the hieroglyphics above the
figure are in the original of a blue colour, as represented, with
the exception of the two lines of large hieroglyphics in this plate,
forming part of the tablet before a figure of the king, seated;
but, as his majesty, in this instance, is very plainly attired,
I have not considered it necessary to give a drawing of him.

Part III. contains two rows of figures immediately underneath the
three rows of Part I. The people represented in the first row of this
plate are all white, with blue eyes, red hair, and pointed beards:
they are dressed in long robes, open in front, like the caftans of
the Turks. The first group is curious, exhibiting one of these men
leading a bear, and having on his shoulders a tooth of an elephant,
while behind him is a representation of that animal. The features of
these figures resemble those of the Jews: their complexion, and one
of them having a long glove in his hand, certainly indicate their
coming from a cold country. The elephant must be from Ethiopia: if,
therefore, they are the Scythians, as some suppose, they must be
employed as slaves bearing the produce of Ethiopia. It is possible
that they are natives of the mountains of Abyssinia, who are now
so much whiter than the natives of the valley of the Nile of the
same latitude; but I think it far more probable that they are white
slaves of the king of Ethiopia, sent to the Egyptian king as the most
acceptable present. The same people are leading an elegant car and a
pair of horses. The plate will show their beautiful manner of drawing
that animal, almost equal to the Grecian. The lowest row represents
the Egyptians leading two rows of another race of white men. They
are without beards, have blue hair and eyes, and are dressed in long
gowns: from their position, they must be either strings of prisoners,
or recruits drilling for the army: behind them are their wives,
curiously dressed, carrying and leading their children. The latter
are painted red, as if born in Ethiopia, whither their parents had
been brought prisoners. The Egyptian border at the bottom of this
plate heightens considerably the effect of the painting.

Part IV., the last compartment of this grand procession, represents,
in the upper row, five of the Jewish-looking figures, with their
aquiline noses, bearing large vases. The second bears an elegant bow
and quiver full of arrows; the third has a long glove in his hand;
and the fourth, perhaps, an ivory bottle. The offerings in the centre
are almost similar to those I have described before. There are some
bundles of reeds, and two vases of a blue article, perhaps indigo. The
lowest row contains a group of seven male Ethiopian slaves, recruits
I conceive for the army; behind them are their wives and children; one
of the latter in a pannier suspended from the head of its mother. The
figures in this row are not, like those above, bearing presents; the
Egyptian scribe at the end is, however, represented, as in the other
instances, writing on his scroll, which confirms the idea that they
are slaves forming part of the tribute to the great Egyptian king.

Athenæus (see lib. v.), in his description of the festival given
by Ptolemy Philadelphus to the Alexandrians, mentions, that in the
procession there was a number of Ethiopians, carrying the teeth of
600 elephants. Others bore two thousand blocks of ebony, and some
were loaded with vessels of gold and silver, containing the finest
gold. Besides these, there were 2,400 dogs, men bearing trees, and
a number of animals, both beasts and birds, parroquets, and other
birds of Ethiopia, carried in cages; 130 Ethiopian sheep, 300 Arabian,
and 20 from the island of Nubia; 26 Indian buffaloes, white as snow,
and 8 from Ethiopia; three brown bears, and a white one, 14 leopards,
16 panthers, 4 lynxes, 1 giraffe, and a rhinoceros of Ethiopia. The
reader has only to refer to my drawings to perceive how admirably
the procession, represented on the walls of this tomb, erected
at the time of Thothmes III., considering it also as a pictorial
representation, agrees with the one described by Athenæus, and the
tribute mentioned by Herodotus as paid to the Persians 1000 years
after the reign of Thothmes.

In the voyage of Scylax round the world mention is made of the
Ethiopians. Although the account is rather confused, particularly
as to their situation, the description agrees so remarkably, in many
instances, with the people represented in these plates, that I cannot
refrain from giving part of it. “The nation whom they traffic
with are the Ethiopians, who sell them skins of stags and lions,
precious stones, skins and teeth of elephants, and droves of domestic
animals. The richest furniture of these Ethiopians consists in _carved
vases_, and of bottles of ivory. They wear beards and _long hair_;
they are the most beautiful men on the earth: he who has the finest
figure is chosen their chief. They are excellent horsemen, and very
skilful archers. They drink milk, but also wine, which they make in
great quantities from the vines that they cultivate. They have a large
town, where the Phœnicians carry their merchandise. Some pretend that
the Ethiopians inhabit a vast territory, extending from Egypt to the
sea.” The skins, precious stones, ivory, herds of cattle, carved
vases, ivory bottles, long hair, use of the bow and arrows, agree in
an extraordinary manner with the representations in these plates. The
large town, to which the Phœnicians traded, was, perhaps, Meroe.

This grand procession may perhaps be merely a representation of
an amicable present made on the part of the Ethiopians to the king
Thothmes; but as that Egyptian monarch waged war against Ethiopia,
built the temple of Semneh, and left his name in an inscription on
the rocks at Toumbos, this painting (particularly as it is depicted
in the most conspicuous part of his tomb) may reasonably be supposed
to represent either a tribute from the conquered regions, or the
price at which Ethiopia obtained a peace.

When Egypt grew into importance, before the commencement of those
wars which were so fatal to the prosperity of the kingdom of Meroe,
her colonies in that country would be a great source of wealth;
receiving the manufactures of the mother country, and sending back
in return the rich productions of the more northern valley of the
Nile. The Bahr el Abiad and the Bahr el Azruk would enable her
merchants to carry their manufactures among the wild natives of the
interior. It is now impossible to say how far that commerce extended
in that direction. The difference of religion, supposing it to have
existed, was probably not very great, nor does history lead us to
suppose, that there existed the same bigotry which now separates the
Mahometan from the Pagan. The former religion, particularly at its
commencement, was most intolerant; its believers being almost bound
to propagate it with the sword. This will account for the little
communication which, according to the tradition of the country,
has existed for several centuries between the present inhabitants
of Shendy, that is, Meroe, and the still wilder tribes of the
interior. The Arab princes of this country made excursions into the
interior, not as merchants, to exchange the produce of the land,
and diffuse the seeds of knowledge and civilisation, but with arms
in their hands, to force their weaker neighbours to embrace their
faith, and, in later times, to drag their children into captivity;
but we cannot suppose that a wise and civilised people could have
adopted so impolitic a course. The account given by the historians
of the different sects which existed, even in the kingdom of Meroe,
prove that toleration was then allowed.

Meroe, therefore, possessed local advantages far greater than have
been enjoyed by many great commercial states; and I now hope to
show, that her internal resources, until exhausted or decayed,
were sufficient to insure a continuation of that prosperity. Her
great superiority over other states would consist, not only in the
productions of the soil, but principally in her standing singly
pre-eminent in civilisation. That science and knowledge of the arts,
when applied to commerce, enriched her citizens, and enabled them
to indulge their taste for luxury, for architectural ornament, and
to encourage her artists. What was of greater importance, it would
afford to many the means of devoting their lives to the pursuit
of literature; the same activity would, of course, to a certain
degree, be applied to the improvement of her manufactures, and the
production of useful and ornamental articles, for which the natives
of the interior would gladly give in exchange that precious metal,
which is only valuable for what it procures.

My article on the state of the arts at Meroe will show the skill and
science possessed by her inhabitants; which, with their wealth and
commercial habits, would be employed in useful and elegant inventions,
with their monopoly of which their uncivilised neighbours would be
unable to interfere. I have stated in my topographical description
of the pyramids of Meroe, how the evidence of all travellers—that a
great part of the soil of Egypt, and the whole of the Delta, has been
brought down from Ethiopia by the Nile,—agrees with the testimony
of the historians, particularly of Diodorus, and the information
they received in a country, the natives of which were more likely
to conceal than invent such an account.

The first great source of the power of Meroe was probably the extreme
fertility of her soil, and the abundance of her harvests. Those
banks, which are now in a great many instances entirely covered
by the sands of the desert, were doubtless then overspread with
that rich soil which astonishes the traveller in Egypt, and her
country was resorted to perhaps by the natives of less favoured
climes, as the richest under the sun.[86] With regard to her mines,
notwithstanding what Diodorus says, I suspect, as formerly stated,
that this great source of her wealth was derived more from the centre
of Africa; but it is true that the interior of the island has never
yet been fully explored. If any remains of those riches now exist,
access to them is almost impossible, at all events for an individual,
in consequence of the number of ferocious and terrible animals with
which that tract is infested.

I have described Meroe, such as she must have been in the zenith of
her greatness,—the emporium of the commerce of interior Africa, the
cradle and early seat of arts, science, and civilisation. Such was she
in the height of her prosperity; but, as the sun which rises must set,
and nation must succeed nation in the career of improvement, I must
now endeavour to account for her gradual decline, and the chain of
circumstances which finally caused her name to be erased from the
list of kingdoms. The first cause perhaps was the failure of her
internal resources, in consequence of the Nile carrying down yearly
to Egypt a portion of her richest soil, and the deserts encroaching
on her plains. She thus became dependent on foreign countries for
an adequate supply of those necessaries, of which her territory
perhaps formerly produced a superfluity. Those mines also, whether
on her own territory or farther in the interior, which furnished
such an abundance of the precious metal, would in course of time
become exhausted; or accidental circumstances might interrupt her
commercial intercourse with the countries which supplied them. Her
inhabitants, finding the soil swept away by the Nile, would follow the
course of the river, and establish themselves in Egypt. The latter
country, besides the extraordinary advantages afforded by it to the
cultivators, would, by instructions received from these Ethiopian
colonies, almost immediately rise to an equal rank of civilisation and
knowledge. We have seen that the same religion, the same mysteries,
the same writing, and the same style of architecture, existed in
the two countries. The land of Egypt would increase every year in
fertility, and the tree of knowledge, planted in that genial soil,
would spread wide its branches. The activity too of a more northern
region, and the energies of a less corrupted nation, would raise
the people of Egypt above those of Ethiopia, then perhaps become
more luxurious, and consequently more indolent.

In the earliest ages, Meroe might have profited by a commerce with
her Egyptian colonies; the markets of the latter country might,
for a short time, have been supplied with produce and manufactures
of Arabia and the Indies, from the mother country; but it is not
to be supposed that the Egyptians would have been so deficient in
intelligence, and the Arabians in common sense, as not to perceive
the advantage of a direct communication.[87] The Egyptian ports of
Myos Hormos and Berenice, and others, possessed also the advantage of
being less distant from the river, and afforded to the Arabians the
means of supplying rich and populous Egypt with the productions of
the Indies and the peninsula. Philostratus (2 de Vitâ Apollonii,
l. iii. c. 35.) says, that a certain prince named Eythus (who
is supposed by some, but, I conceive, erroneously, to be Esau)
dispossessed the Egyptians of their trade in the Red Sea, making
a law, that they should not navigate that sea with more than one
merchant ship at a time; but the Egyptians built one of immense size,
to supply the place of several. Their trade at that time could not
have been very extensive, if it could be carried on by any one
vessel; but perhaps, as in the time of Joseph, who (see Genesis
xxxvii. 25.) was sold by his brethren to a company of Ishmaelites,
the descendants of Ishmael, the son of Abraham by Hagar, 1730 B.C.,
travelling from Gilead, with their camels, bearing spices and myrrh
for the Egyptian market, they had a considerable land commerce with
the Arabians: the caravan I have just alluded to must, by the nature
of the produce, have come from Arabia.

The Jews, in the time of Solomon, carried on a great trade in the
Red Sea, and imported gold from Ophir. “And Huram sent him, by
the hands of his servants, ships, and servants that had knowledge
of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and
took thence 450 talents of gold, and brought them to King Solomon.”
(2 Chron. viii. 18.)—“And the Queen of Sheba (chap. ix. 9.) gave
King Solomon 120 talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and
precious stones.” And in the same chapter, 13th and 14th verses,
we find that Solomon received, “in one year, 666 talents of gold,
beside that which chapmen and merchants brought; and all the kings
of Arabia brought gold and silver to Solomon.” These passages are
important, as showing one particular district of Ethiopia, where gold
was found in abundance. The gold brought by the chiefs of Arabia,
I conceive not to have been the natural production of that country,
but the fruit of their industry and commerce with the Ethiopians. As
Solomon was son-in-law to the Pharaoh of Egypt, the latter was,
probably, not excluded from the commerce. Ezekiel mentions Ethiopia as
one of the upholders of Egypt; and (chapter xxx. verse 9.) he says,
“In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make
the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them,
as in the day of Egypt.” The expression “careless,” I conceive,
alludes to the security which they, no doubt, felt in their power,
and the natural protection their rocky cataracts afforded them for
resisting an invader. Their being afraid of ships almost leads me
to suppose that they could have had little or no navy, or wherefore
that apprehension? for there is no doubt that their land army,
even in the most distant times, was very great. I have shown, in my
historical chapter, that Zerah, the Ethiopian, marched with a host
of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots.

But these remarks regard chiefly the navigation, for whether the
produce was brought in the vessels of Eythus (whom I conceive to
have been an Arabian king), of the Jews, or of the Tyrians (Strabo,
c. 16.), or Syrians (_Id._ 17.), and eventually by the ships of the
Ptolemies and Cæsars, little affects the question, as Egypt was,
in every case, the emporium of the merchandise. That enterprising
spirit and activity which always characterise a rising nation,
would lead the Egyptians into the markets of the centre of Africa,
and thus inflict another blow on the prosperity of Meroe. We know
what Alexandria became, from the immense commerce with the East which
it continued to enjoy, notwithstanding the impediments occasioned by
the ignorance and barbarism of its governments, until the Portuguese
discovery of the passage by the Cape. After that event, which led the
commerce of the Indies into another channel, Alexandria and Kosseer
dwindled into obscurity, having lost, as Meroe had previously done,
that great source of wealth.

Strabo says, quoting from Cicero, that Auletes, the father of
Cleopatra, drew from Egypt 12,500 talents, more than two millions
and a half sterling. Diodorus only calculated the revenue at
half that sum. The observations which Strabo afterwards makes are
important. “If,” says he, “the revenue was so considerable,
under the negligent and bad rule of that prince, what will it be now
that it is governed with so much care, and that the commerce of the
Indies and of the country of the Troglodites is increased so much;
for formerly,” said he, “they counted only twenty vessels, who
dared to advance beyond the entrance of the Arabian Gulf, whilst
now considerable fleets sail to the Indies and to the extremities
of Ethiopia, whence the most precious merchandise is brought into
Egypt, and thence sent into other countries. In this manner they
have a double tax on the imports and exports, in proportion to the
value of the merchandise;” and he adds, that “Alexandria is the
principal depôt for their merchandise, and the place of commerce
which furnishes other countries with it in great abundance.” This
account is curious, as it shows that, until the time of Strabo, the
Egyptian trade with the Indians was not very extensive: its increase
would naturally diminish the commercial relations of Meroe.[88]

It is also remarkable, that about the time when Meroe began to
decline, Egypt was most famous for her commerce. Psammetichus, who
reigned six centuries and a half before our era, almost immediately
after the expulsion or retirement of the Ethiopian dynasty, gained
great wealth by trade before he was King of Egypt. The richest and
most magnificent tombs of private individuals, now remaining at
Thebes, belong chiefly to that era, proving a degree of opulence
unequalled at any other period.

I have shown, in my historical chapter, that, notwithstanding the
diminution of the trade of Meroe with India and Arabia, she was
still able to resist the armies of the Egyptians. The pyramids of
Geezah and the tombs of Beni Hassan are proofs of the great wealth
and power of the latter, even so early as the 16th dynasty; and
during the 18th dynasty the Kings Thothmes, Amunoph, &c. invaded
Ethiopia. Yet, notwithstanding the power of those princes, it seems,
according to the evidence of Herodotus[89], and of the monuments
themselves, that Rameses II. was the only Egyptian king who subdued
Ethiopia; but a hero sprang up in the 8th century, who, in return,
conquered Egypt. Shabak, and his successors Shabatok and Tahraka,
reigned over that country forty-four years. The power of Meroe
must have been very great, even at that period, to have enabled her
armies to make such an important conquest, and extend her sway from
Meroe to the Mediterranean. It is also wonderful that it should
have been so little impaired by the diminution of her commerce,
and the decline of her internal resources. I have described the
power of the priests, whose influence was so great at the time
of Ergamenes, who was contemporary to Ptolemy, that that prince,
who had received a liberal education, had recourse to the violent
measure of attacking and slaying them at their altars. The chief
cause of the decline of Meroe was probably the injury this theocratic
government had inflicted on the country; for we cannot suppose that
the people would have submitted to the destruction of the ministers
of their religion, had there not been some deep causes of complaint,
and a general consciousness that their mismanagement and bigotry
had plunged the country into distress. The lamentable decline of
the arts at this period proves that the resources of the country
were entirely occupied in maintaining a force sufficient to defend
it from invasion, and its diminished commerce and wealth offered
less means of encouragement to artists. War, not the fine arts and
intellectual cultivation, was become the necessary occupation of
the nation. The resources of Meroe, even for some time afterwards,
must have been considerable, that their Queen Candace could check
the Roman arms; but the expedition of Petronius, already described,
ruining all the country between Syene and Napata, and destroying the
cities which had escaped from the previous desolating war between
the Ethiopians and the Egyptians, must have inflicted a deep blow
on the prosperity of Meroe. That queen, indeed, followed the Roman
army in its retreat, and finally, drove them from Premnis; but the
long series of wars would, of course, hasten the decline of a country
whose internal resources had long been gradually diminishing. Pliny
says[90], that at the time of Candace, which name for many years the
Ethiopian queens had assumed, there were few edifices in the city
of Meroe; but, after mentioning the holy shrine of Hammon, and the
small temple and chapels on the road, bearing testimony to the power
of the Ethiopians, he describes the island as once of great renown,
having an army of 250,000 men, and 400,000 artificers. The number of
artificers, supposing even that in that class are comprised artists,
craftsmen, manufacturers, and all labourers not agriculturists,
is enormous, and proves a vast degree of industry and civilisation.

Even in the eighth century, after the country had become Christian,
her monarchs were so powerful, that it was asserted, about the year
737, that the kings of Nubia and Ethiopia could bring into the field
100,000 horse, and as many camels. When Christianity was spread over
Ethiopia, the painter’s and sculptor’s skill would be no longer
necessary to make representations of their gods but the ministers of
the gospel at that time were more occupied in schismatical disputes,
and in making converts to their peculiar and often fanciful tenets,
than in propagating the pure principles of their religion, dispelling
the darkness of superstition, and advancing the civilisation and
prosperity of the kingdom.

According to the tradition which I learned at Dongolah, in the
reign of the fourth caliph after Mahomet this country was conquered
by the Arabs, and the inhabitants blended with the conquerors, who
forced them to become Mussulmen, or drove them out of the country,
probably into Abyssinia.

After all that has been said, those who view the present rude and
degraded state of this territory may feel a difficulty in believing
that it ever could be so enlightened and flourishing as I have now
described it. They ought, however, to consider, that it is not more
surprising that Meroe, under the uncivilised and ignorant dominion
of the Arabs, would lose all knowledge of the arts, than that the
little island of Rhodes, once eminent for power, civilisation, and
commerce, should now, although not, like Meroe, deprived of her rich
soil, be equally ignorant and barbarous. Syracuse, from the same
cause, had risen to such a height of civilisation and power, as to
be able to resist the vast efforts of the Athenians; and finally,
with little assistance, inflict a deadly blow on the prosperity
of the city of Minerva. What is Tunis, compared to Carthage? Where
are Tyre and Sidon, the cities of Phœnicia? If it was necessary,
numerous similar examples might be adduced, of the vicissitudes to
which kingdoms and cities are liable. Sufficient reasons have been
assigned for the downfall of Meroe. The failure of her commerce;
her rich soil carried away, or swallowed up by the deserts, and
the consequent diminution of her population; her mines exhausted,
and the active rivalry of a nation finally more powerful; the long
and ruinous wars with Egypt; and at last the Arabian conquest, swept
away every trace of her affluence and civilisation: the invaders,
with a brand in one hand, burning her libraries[91] and edifices, and
in the other the sword, forcing her subjects to embrace a different
faith, and renounce the arts and knowledge of their ancestors.

In a country where the arts are now totally unknown, and which
is become little better than a desert, it is not surprising to
find commerce reduced to the mere exchange of the most absolute
necessaries of life, and a few trifling superfluities. Small caravans
occasionally go from Shendy to Abyssinia. Sometimes the rulers of
the latter country do not permit them to enter their dominions,
and civil wars not unfrequently put an entire stop to the trade; but
when, as is generally the case, the merchants succeed in procuring
an entrance, they inform me that the profits on their Cairo goods
are enormous. They receive in exchange a little ivory; gold, the
value of which is several dollars per ounce lower there than in
Egypt; a very fine species of cotton scarf, much esteemed and worn
by the Abyssinian women in the Turkish harems, and the Abyssinian
coffee; which, although not equal to the Mocha, is almost the only
kind drunk in Nubia: but their chief return is in slaves. The wars
which generally distract that unfortunate country furnish to each
state abundance of these victims, which, like cattle, are exchanged
with the merchant for the luxuries of Egypt: few are the Turks
who have not Abyssinian girls in their harems, and I have seen
numerous eunuchs brought from that country. It is horrid to think
that beings called Christians should be guilty of such enormities;
but there is no doubt of the fact. The slaves, whether girls or boys,
by compulsion or inclination, invariably become Mahometans.

A caravan also occasionally goes to Souakim, where they get India
stuffs, Mocha coffee, and a great part of the spices, the use of which
is so general. Small caravans also go to Kordofan and Darfour. In
the former of these countries the Pasha of Egypt monopolises the
richest produce, as gum, ivory, and ostrich feathers; but Kordofan
is the chief mart of the negro slaves. The jealousy of the King of
Darfour against any persons going or coming from the dominions of the
Pasha of Egypt, at whose power he trembles, prevents that commerce
being now very extensive. The merchants are very illiterate, and in
general extremely debauched. Even their interest does not check their
dissoluteness, or protect the honour of their poor Abyssinian female
slaves. The supply of gold is very much diminished: some, however,
is still found, and of the finest quality; but in every direction
the caravans regard slaves as the most advantageous exchange for
their goods. They drive them like cattle over the burning sands,
and, what I have been an eye-witness to, over the bones of their
brethren which lie bleaching in the desert. The ingenuity of their
masters seems to be exercised, not in alleviating their pains, but
in devising how to economise their own purses, by discovering on how
little and how coarse food their victims can exist, and what extent of
fatigue and suffering they can endure, and still remain saleable. In
the district which we have seen to have been once the emporium of the
East, there remains only this miserable traffic. Instead of palaces
and splendid edifices, there are now only rude and miserable huts. Of
the power, civilisation, and wealth of Meroe, not a vestige remains to
corroborate the testimony of the historians but a few small temples,
and the splendid sepulchres of her departed kings.

It has appeared in the preceding chapters, that the kingdom of
Meroe was the emporium of the interior of Africa, and from her rich
productions, and the abundance of her precious metals, was resorted
to by the inhabitants of the regions in her vicinity. This influx
of population would naturally oblige many to employ their capital
and talent in other pursuits besides commerce. Every branch of
industry would gradually improve; a rich and luxurious people would
constantly desire new objects to please the fancy, and contribute
to the enjoyment of life. The son of the merchant, who had earned
great wealth, would, as in our days, be able to reap the fruits
of that industry. Some might indulge in foolish extravagance; but
others would place their enjoyment in the encouragement of the arts,
or in those studies which gratify and enrich the mind, and, at the
same time, tend to improve and civilise society.

In so fertile a country, a great proportion of the principal
landed proprietors, besides those who had realised large fortunes
by commerce, must have been able to pass their lives in literary
leisure, and employ their fortune in the encouragement of the arts,
and the propagation of science. Even the heat of the climate would
contribute to the advancement of civilisation. In Europe, particularly
in its northern districts, how many consume a great portion of their
time and fortune in the healthy, but rough, amusement of the chase;
but in the tropics, the greatest luxury is repose. I have remarked
repeatedly, that the rich natives of the climates of the East rarely
expose themselves to the heat of the sun, except when necessity
absolutely requires it, as on a journey; and even then as little as
possible. It is considered one of the greatest advantages of rank and
fortune, that its possessors can enjoy the luxury of shade during
the whole day, while their less fortunate brethren are obliged to
toil under a burning sun.

The same natural causes, operating equally in ancient times, would
give to the Ethiopians an inclination for sedentary pursuits, which
would be advantageous to their advancement in the different branches
of science, as soon as their taste for them had been unfolded. That
rivalry which always arises among bodies of men, would urge to the
improvement of the arts. The great and wealthy would endeavour
to surpass each other in the beauty and magnificence of their
palaces, and they would emulously display their piety to the gods,
by contributing to the building and decorating the temples, and
their munificence and generosity, by the construction of edifices
of public utility.

This is not an imaginary picture. Let the reader look at the drawings
of Meroe, and candidly say whether, in a country containing architects
able to construct such chaste and beautiful monuments, men could
have spent the superfluity of wealth, derived from commerce,
in mere sensual indulgence? Was the knowledge of architecture,
sculpture, and painting, exclusively employed in the construction of
the sepulchres of her monarchs and the temples of the gods? Can it
be supposed that those who must have had the means, would content
themselves with wretched huts, when their wealth enabled them to
employ their skilful architects in erecting commodious and elegant
habitations, suitable to their rank? Can we imagine that the gentry
of a kingdom, famous in antiquity for its civilisation, would spend
their time, like the Turks, in listless indolence, and would not seek
to distinguish themselves by studies and learning? But Diodorus,
speaking of the language of hieroglyphics, says, that, in Egypt,
the priests only were acquainted with them, whilst, in Ethiopia,
they were generally understood. This shows that civilisation was
widely diffused among the people, who apparently were not content,
like their neighbours, to view without understanding the tablets of
writing and sculpture which ornamented the walls of their temples.

Unfortunately, the remains of pure Ethiopian art, at all events,
those of the earliest period, are but few. The pyramids of Nouri,
but particularly those of Meroe, must have been built many ages
before the temples of Gibel el Birkel, especially the one finished by
Tirhaka: the style of the sculpture differs so widely, that a slight
examination only is necessary to prove that a long period must have
intervened before, in a country like this, the style could have so
materially changed. I place, then, the pyramids of Meroe among the
earliest specimens now existing of the skill of the Ethiopians. In my
description of those ruins, I have extolled the beautiful simplicity
of the architecture, imposing, and, at the same time, elegant, in
a superior degree to the immense pyramids of Geezah. The sepulchres
of Meroe delight us by evincing the greatest purity of taste, while
they are not, like the Egyptian pyramids, monuments of the tyranny
and oppression of their kings.

The different plates I have given of the sculpture in the porticoes
of Meroe, at Gibel el Birkel (see Plates X., XI., and XII., and
particularly Plate XI., which contains a number of vases,) display
a great degree of elegance, and, perhaps, a refined simplicity,
equal to what we find in Egyptian sculpture.

The offerings (see Plate XXIX.) are the animals of the country
and surrounding deserts. The group with branches of the palm
tree, is quite Ethiopian, and very beautiful; but the splendid
procession alluded to, in treating of the commerce, as existing in
a tomb at Thebes, is particularly instructive: the Ethiopians are
there represented carrying presents to a great man at the time of
Thothmes. Besides the ivory, ebony, gold, silver, skins, and animals,
enumerated in my last chapter, they are also represented bearing
different kinds of vases. These evince a degree of elegance and
refinement which has never been surpassed. They are not ornamented
with figures like the Phœnician, Etruscan, Greek, and Roman vases,
but in taste and elegant simplicity of form they are not surpassed by
those of any nation. Such discoveries as these afford the strongest
evidence of the civilisation of a people. No learning or profound
knowledge of the arts is required to understand, that a nation,
among whom have been wrought such rich and magnificent vases as are
now to be found in London, could be barbarians.

When a people have attained a certain degree of taste, such
knowledge is never confined to one branch. The cultivated minds,
which could appreciate such works of art as the pyramids of Meroe,
and were accustomed to such a degree of elegance in their domestic
ornaments, could not, I conceive, have been uncivilised, generally
speaking. These vases, like the chairs and furniture represented on
the walls of Thebes, admit us at once to a knowledge of the private
life of the people. We cannot doubt the luxury and refinement of the
private life of the Egyptians, when we find represented, in one of
the tombs of the kings at Thebes, more beautiful patterns of chairs,
cushions, &c. than are now to be found in Europe. As little can we
imagine, that apartments, ornamented with such elegant vases as the
Ethiopians are represented offering to the Egyptians, would not in
every other respect be furnished with equal taste. I think, then,
that I am not too bold in asserting, that the people who had skill
to devise, and ability to execute, such beautiful works of art,
are entitled to a very high rank in the scale of civilisation. To
the other proofs that they are Ethiopian, I should add, their long
curly hair, their peculiar dress, differing from the Egyptian, the
similarity with the few vases which I found sculptured on the walls
at Meroe, (see Plate XI.) and, most of all, the hieroglyphics written
over the procession, which state them to be from the land of Ethiopia.

Another important proof of the extensive architectural skill of
the Ethiopians is their knowledge and employment of the arch. In
my narrative, I have described that which exists in one of the
porticoes of Meroe, having the form of the segment of a circle,
and have mentioned also the pointed arch in a pyramid at Gibel el
Berkel. Both are constructed on the true principle of being supported
only by lateral pressure. The pyramids of Meroe being the oldest,
we may say that the earliest specimen of the arch now existing is
on the site of the capital of Ethiopia. I conceive it very likely,
that the necessity of finding some method of resisting the tropical
rains led the Ethiopians to the invention of the arch; as of course,
slight even as they are here, they would be obliged to pay more
attention to their roofs than in Egypt, where, with few exceptions,
sometimes, especially in Upper Egypt, not exceeding once in the year,
it may almost be said never to rain. The rains which fall at Shendy
are, however, rarely heavy. As I have noticed in my topographical
description (page 156.), the only specimens of the arch in Egypt
belong to that period when wars existed between the two countries,
and the Egyptians would have the opportunity of learning that
invention from the Ethiopians. It is also singular, that there
is not a stone arch in Egypt regularly constructed, except one,
before mentioned, of the time of Psammitichus, who reigned after the
Ethiopian dynasty. The only specimens which show the Egyptians to have
been acquainted with the true mode of forming one, is a brick arch,
erected at the time of Amunoph, and another of the time of Thothmes
III. They are formed of crude bricks; the size of which is seven
inches by five. (See Vignettes.) Is it not singular, that although
these and other brick arches at Thebes are regularly constructed,
the specimens there and elsewhere in stone, lead us to infer, that
they were acquainted with the beauty of the arch as an architectural
ornament, but not with its great utility? I refer to that arch near
to the temple excavated out of the rock, in the valley of Hassaseef,
at Thebes, of the time of Amunoph, which is formed by approaching
stones (see Vignette), and numerous excavations in the valley of
the Nile, where the roofs are hollowed slightly into the arched
form. As, therefore, no specimen of even a brick arch exists before
the reign of those kings who carried their arms into Ethiopia; and
as the pyramids of Ethiopia are evidently so very ancient, it seems
highly probable that this important discovery had there its origin.

[Illustration: STONE ARCH AT THEBES.]

The tomb in which the elliptical arch (see Vignette) exists,
is near the valley of the Sepulchre of the Queens, at Thebes. It
is almost filled up to the ceiling with mummies, which occasioned
great difficulty to get at the spring of the arch. It is a painted
tomb, and the roof is plastered; and over the plaster, along the
centre, is a line of hieroglyphics, containing the name of Amunoph
I.; proving the existence of the knowledge of the arch in Egypt,
about fifteen centuries and a half before the Christian era. It is
also very remarkable, that this arch is not a segment of a circle,
but elliptical. A part of the ceiling being broken, discovered the
space between the ceiling and the rock.

[Illustration: BRICK ARCH IN A TOMB AT THEBES.]

On the road from the Memnonium to the valley of the Hassaseef, a
little elevated on a rock, is a very small painted tomb, which is
also vaulted. The vignette represents the arch of the roof resting
on the rock, and the inner arch of a recess at the end. This recess,
as likewise the whole tomb, is covered with a coating of plaster;
and on one of the jambs of the recess are the titles and prænomen of
Thothmes III., “Sun, Establisher of the World,” fifth king of the
eighteenth dynasty, who reigned about fifteen centuries before the
Christian era. The present access to this tomb is through a hole in
the ceiling, from the floor of another tomb. This fracture discovers
satisfactorily the construction of the arch. The sections, therefore,
of the pointed arch at Gibel el Birkel (see Plate XXVIII.), of the
circular one at the site of the metropolis of Ethiopia (see Plate
VII.), and this elliptical and circular arch at Thebes, will, I think,
satisfy the most sceptical, that the Romans were not the first who
were acquainted with the power and principle of the arch. We have
here, undoubtedly, the geometrical forms; and in answer to the _cui
bono_ of the learned author of the able article in the last Quarterly
Review[92], I must state that the Ethiopian arches were obviously
invented to resist the rains; as the peasants of Sennaar have conical
roofs to their cottages for the same purpose. The brick arches at
Thebes, I conceive to have been erected not merely as ornaments, but,
as regards the one of the time of Amunoph III., for the purpose of
protecting it from the partial decomposition of the calcareous rock,
which happens to be there less solid, while the tomb of the time
of Thothmes III., being immediately beneath another, suggested the
utility, if not necessity, of strengthening the roof with an arch.

[Illustration: BRICK ARCH IN A TOMB AT THEBES.]

The Ethiopian sculpture has the same defects as the Egyptian,
as to the manner of representing the profile of the face, but the
bodies have a roundness which distinguishes them entirely from the
Egyptian. The latter is more graceful and pleasing to the eye, when
the traveller is accustomed to that peculiarity of style, but I do
conceive the Ethiopian to be, in some respects, more true to nature.

It may be asked why, advanced as the Ethiopians were in the arts,
they did not draw the human figure better, and more in accordance
with nature. It is difficult, and, I must confess, almost impossible,
to explain quite satisfactorily this circumstance. The Egyptians,
as I have said, had a style still more unnatural, yet few can doubt
their high degree of civilisation. The general form of the figures
gives one the idea of their being very early efforts of art. It
seems to me very possible, that the invention of the sculptor and
painter may have been first exercised on the walls of some celebrated
temple; and this defective representation may, from the sacredness
of the place, have become the conventional style of the country. The
bigotted veneration which the people would naturally feel for those
forms under which their divinities were first represented, may have
made them consider it lawful, indeed, to improve the delineation,
but criminal to attempt to change it entirely.

The Egyptians and the Ethiopians were equally ignorant of
perspective. When Egypt was under the dominion of the Greeks and
Romans, we perceive that policy and respect for the prejudices of
the people prevented those nations from making any innovations in
the national style. The differences between the sculpture, at those
periods, and during the eighteenth dynasty, cannot be called so much
changes, as marks of the great decline of the pure Egyptian art. No
figures, on the walls of the temples, are sculptured or painted in the
pure Greek or Roman style. Those rulers of Egypt, though of course
acquainted with the latter, continued to follow the Egyptian style
in all the edifices that they erected. The only instances in which
they seem to have deviated at all from this rule, are in some few
portraits found on Greek mummies. This renders it probable that there
existed a strong religious prejudice on the subject, and that the
Ethiopians and Egyptians were as tenacious of the forms and costumes
of their divinities, as religious sects, in more recent times, have
shown themselves about the dress and appearance of their ministers.

There is, therefore, no reason to suppose, that the Ethiopians
were unable to draw figures correctly, because, from reverence
to the antiquity of their religion, and the superstition of the
people, they did not improve the forms of their divinities. Faulty,
however, as that style is, both in design and colour, it has still
its attractions, though, in saying so, I may be accused of being
an admirer of deformity. Their formality is not inappropriate to
sacred edifices. Travellers daily become reconciled to its defects,
and at last admire what at first appeared to them so strange. No
one can have visited the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes, without
an enthusiastic admiration of the beautiful and rich harmony of
the colouring, the taste displayed in the ornaments, the spirited
execution of the animals and hieroglyphics, and the magical effect
of the decorations. We see, in the fragments which still exist, that
the Ethiopians drew animals, and also ornaments, very beautifully. We
may therefore consider it almost certain, that they could have drawn
the human figure better had they been permitted.

There are few traces of colour remaining on any Ethiopian edifice,
yet I found sufficient in one of the porticoes of the pyramids
of Gibel el Birkel, to enable me to ascertain the important fact,
that the colouring was similar to the Egyptian. That of the human
body is of the same red tint; and is it not singular that man is
represented of the same complexion in Ethiopia as in every part of
Egypt? Such a coincidence could only arise from the circumstance of
the one people having derived their knowledge of the arts from the
other. The colouring of the Ethiopians and Egyptians was of course,
like the form of the figure, conventional. Now, I ask the reader,
Where is it most probable that this colour was first established? Was
it in a country where the inhabitants must have been nearly of that
dark tint represented in these sculptures, or was it in one, 1700
miles farther north, where the people must have been, as they are
now, yellow, or, comparatively speaking, white. The first colonies
which introduced the arts into Egypt would naturally represent their
divinities under the same appearance as in the mother country, and
the first kings, and other persons making offerings, would of course
be the colonists. Impressed with reverence for the first models
presented to them, the Egyptians would continue to use this colour,
tacitly acknowledging, by this circumstance, that they derived the
knowledge of the arts from Ethiopia. There are several representations
in Egypt of black men and black queens, but these almost invariably
bear the negro features. Even if they were intended to represent
Ethiopians, that colour could only be a mark of distinction,
afterwards introduced, as of a blacker nation than themselves;
for we find the Ethiopians, on their own edifices, represented as
exactly of the same tint as the Egyptians of Thebes and Memphis.

If the artist were to paint them of one of the six colours with which
they were acquainted,—white, red, green, blue, yellow, or black,
the one approaching nearest to what was probably the real Ethiopian
complexion, would certainly be the red. We shall be confirmed in this
conclusion, if we consider the latitude and the colour of the present
cultivators of the soil. Though they speak the Arabic language, they
are most probably (and the tradition I heard at Dongolah confirms the
supposition) descended from the race of the true Ethiopians, obliged,
by force, to adopt the language and religion of their conquerors. That
people, from their climate, could not have been white, and, had they
been black, they would have so represented themselves. The Copts,
the descendants of the Egyptians, are fairer than the Fellaheen,
yet the latter look white in Ethiopia, contrasted with the present
inhabitants of that country. It must also be considered that the
Arab conquerors, being from the southern part of their country,
and therefore darkened by the climate and the desert life they led,
would, to a certain extent, give a darker tint to the Ethiopians;
nevertheless, I have given views of some Berbers whose complexions are
decidedly lighter than they are represented on the walls. (See Plate
XVI.) We must recollect also that it has ever been a custom of the
Orientals to represent themselves and their mistresses as beautifully
fair. The present Ethiopians esteem nothing more than a light
complexion. Before they were accustomed to Europeans, they looked
with horror on what they considered their unnatural whiteness; but
if an Ethiopian is celebrating in a song the charms of his mistress,
he dwells with the greatest rapture on her fair skin. The petty kings
seek wives of equal rank with themselves, chiefly on account of their
fair complexion, which the daughters of the meleks acquire by being
generally confined to the house; particularly as all mixture with
the negro blood is carefully shunned. The colour most approaching
to nature, if this conventional one had originated in Egypt, would
certainly have been the white, or rather light yellow. Such must
have been the colour of the Egyptians; and we cannot suppose that
they would pay themselves so bad a compliment as to represent their
complexion so many shades darker than it must really have been. Here
then we have another great proof that civilisation and art descended
the river. I have mentioned, in my topographical description, the
passages of Diodorus which state shortly, but explicitly, that the
Ethiopians stated the Egyptians to have derived all their knowledge
from them. The inquiries of that intelligent traveller penetrated
through the veil which the pride of the Egyptians, jealous, and
anxious to magnify their antiquity, had thrown over the origin of
their institutions; and when to this national propensity we add the
obstinate wars, which would naturally eradicate every attachment to
their parent land, and induce them to conceal their obligations to
Ethiopia, it appears surprising how that intelligent traveller should
have been able to ascertain the fact, that civilisation descended
from Meroe. Diodorus had no object in inventing that account; and
if the Ethiopians gave it to him in Egypt, he had there the means of
ascertaining the truth from the priests and other learned men, who,
no doubt, were acquainted with the fact; and would have contradicted
it if he had not believed it. Herodotus apparently heard a similar
account. He visited Egypt during the time of the Persian dynasty,
while Diodorus was in that country little more than half a century
(sixty years) before Christ, when the philosophy of the Greeks
may have penetrated through the pride and false pretensions of
the Egyptian priests. Herodotus states that the Egyptians believed
themselves to be from where the race of man first existed (ἐξ
οὗ ἄνθρωπον γένος ἐγένετο). He mentions that the Thebaid was Egypt
before the formation of the Delta[93]: the increase of population
forced them to spread themselves down the valleys, emigrating from
the Thebaid to the Delta, in the same way, no doubt, as they
originally emigrated from Meroe. There is one question connected
with this subject, which, I must confess, is an important one; namely,
by what language the hieroglyphics of both countries are to be
interpreted. Is it by a common one, as emanating from the same origin,
or by a different one in the two countries? I shall not now commit
myself by a discussion and hasty opinion on a subject which I hope to
be better able to treat, as I extend my acquaintance with
hieroglyphics, and with the Coptic and the Ethiopian languages. It
seems to me, however, that if the Egyptians derived their knowledge
of hieroglyphics from Ethiopia, they would, of course, receive from
the same source the language by which they were explained.

With regard to the early literature and science of the Ethiopians,
we know them only by the monuments; but we may rest satisfied, that
they could not have been neglected in a country where, as Diodorus
says, the language of hieroglyphics was generally understood. The
existence of these on the walls of the porticoes of the pyramids, is
a proof that some at least were acquainted with them. It is a very
remarkable circumstance, which, even at the hazard of repetition,
I must impress upon the reader, that notwithstanding the little
sculpture and the few monuments that remain, there is sufficient to
corroborate the very words of Diodorus. The reader who has examined
my drawings will agree with him, that the Ethiopians buried their
dead with as much pomp as the Egyptians; the processions were the
same; and although there is some little difference in the style
of the sculpture and hieroglyphics, it certainly is my conviction,
that the Egyptian style had, as he very correctly expresses himself,
its origin in Ethiopia.[94]

History affords no example, at least that I know, of a people
being so advanced in the fine arts, without at the same time having
applied themselves to the cultivation of the sciences, of history
and philosophy. Their religion, as I may show on another occasion,
evinces their acquaintance with metaphysics, not being a gross
mythology, but the worship, under different forms, of the one great
Divinity, whose attributes are manifested in the wonders of the
creation. A people who had evidently so much taste for the arts,
must have been sensible to the charms of study. Those who had the
means would naturally wish to distinguish themselves, or at least
their children, by various literary acquirements. Individuals seeking
to elevate themselves above the common level would rise together,
and what was at first an extraordinary attainment would become
necessary to secure admittance into society.

The remarks which I have hitherto made on the arts of Ethiopia are
chiefly applicable to their earliest period. In my narrative I have
mentioned, that there are still the remains and traces of 80 pyramids
at Meroe, 42 at Nouri, and 17 at Gibel el Birkel. In the few which
are now nearly entire, the porticoes are decorated with figures
sculptured in the round and bulky Ethiopian style. It is impossible
now to determine positively whether these are representations of
private individuals, of kings, or of members of different royal
families. They represent in several instances, two persons,—a king
and his wife, and there is one instance of a queen only. The tombs
which we can ascertain, from the hieroglyphics, to be those of kings
and queens, being not of superior, or even equal magnitude with many
of the others, I think it not unreasonable to conclude, that every
one of them was erected for a sovereign or some members of a royal
family. If they were each of a king or queen who had reigned alone,
the immense number which can even now be traced, independent of the
many which the desert has swallowed up, would carry us back to an
earlier era than can be admitted, for it is evident, from the style
of the sculpture, and other appearances of the monuments, that they
were erected long previous to the time of Tirhaka, (730 years B.C.)

That Ethiopian king, who reigned over Egypt, constructed a magnificent
temple at Gibel el Birkel, which city, if not the place of his birth,
and at one time the seat of his empire, was at all events peculiarly
favoured by him; for we do not see his name on any Ethiopian edifice,
except on an altar in the great temple, and on the walls and columns
of the temple of Athor at Birkel.

Part of the temple of Tirhaka is excavated out of the rock, either
in imitation of those he had seen in Egypt, or it may perhaps be a
more ancient temple, added to and decorated by that king. The style of
sculpture at that time was tolerably good, very like the Egyptian, but
by no means equal to the best at Thebes. The architecture, however,
seems to have then very much declined. The columns of Athor and the
deformed Pthah in the temple built by Tirhaka, are very inferior to
the fragment we have at Abou Naga, and the great temple at Gibel el
Birkel, built, perhaps, by Pionchei, probably a much more ancient
king. That edifice, for magnificence, may be compared to any in the
valley of the Nile. I may here also remark, that, notwithstanding
the great pecuniary resources which Tirhaka must have possessed, as
king of two such rich and powerful countries as Egypt and Ethiopia,
still the temple erected by him is not to be compared to the splendid
edifice of his predecessor.

It is singular, that, with the exception of the remains of this
large temple, and some other less important vestiges of smaller
edifices there, the colossal statues of Argo, the Ethiopian temple
of Amarah, the fragment of an Ethiopian ruin at Naga, on the Nile,
and the Ethiopian temples at Mecaurat or Naga, in the desert (see
Cailliaud), there are no remains of any sacred edifice of an earlier
period than Tirhaka, or indeed of a later, except the ruins at Wady el
Owataib. The sepulchres of the kings only are standing. The temples
which remain in the best state of preservation above the second
cataract are those of Semneh, built by Thothmes III., an Egyptian
king, and the magnificent temple of Solib, built by Amunoph III.,
also an Egyptian monarch. Petronius, in his hatred for every thing
that was Ethiopian, probably destroyed all the edifices which had
escaped from the ravages of previous wars.

If Gibel el Birkel was Napata (as it is considered by many), the
temples might have been destroyed by Petronius, but I have before
stated, that I cannot conceive it to be that town. We must therefore
attribute its destruction to an earlier era, or to the Christians
or Arabs. The great temple of Gibel el Birkel must have required
great labour to demolish it so utterly. The immense and massive
columns and thick walls would have lasted for ages, had they not
been destroyed by violence. As no attempts have apparently been
made to restore these edifices, the place was perhaps deserted,
and the name erased from among the list of cities. My drawings,
plans, &c. of the temples of Semneh, Solib, and the small temple
at Gibel el Birkel, will show that they are exceedingly ruined,
yet not with the same dreadful destruction as the large temple at
the latter place, and others, of which scarcely a vestige remains.

Some of the pyramids of Gibel el Birkel and Meroe bear evidence
of the greatest violence having been employed to destroy them,
whereas others seem injured only by time. The demolition of the
former, may, I conceive, be entirely attributed to the avarice of
the Mahometans. The very nature of the construction of the pyramids
would certainly present greater difficulties in destroying them,
but this could not have been the motive in forbearing from the
attempt; for all events it would have been easy for the levellers
of whole rows of immense and lofty columns to demolish entirely
every portico. That respect for the sepulchres of the dead, which
has existed in every age, among civilised and uncivilised nations,
prevented probably the devastators from violating the pyramids of
Meroe and Nouri, whilst, at both those places, every trace of the
temples has been obliterated. Religious bigotry must have been the
cause of this violence. The invaders, while they respected the
habitations of the dead, the sepulchres of ancient kings, might
consider the destruction of the sanctuaries to be the surest mode
of eradicating every trace of the idolatrous worship of Ammon.

The monuments of Ethiopia present unfortunately no regular series of
edifices by which we might trace the progressive rise and subsequent
decline of the arts. There is as wide a difference between the most
ancient sculpture and architecture of Meroe and that of the time of
Tirhaka, as between the latter and the far more modern edifice, the
ruins of which are now called Wady el Owataib. In my description
of the latter, (see narrative, Chapter VIII.) I have stated my
belief that it was erected during the last stage of the arts. The
confused and extremely defective plan, and the wretched style of the
sculpture, are proofs that it must have been built very long after
the reign of Tirhaka. I have mentioned also that, from the design,
and from a certain affectation of Greek ornaments, particularly in
the fluting of the columns, I conceive it not improbable, that this,
and also, perhaps, the Greek edifice at Mecaurat, were erected by
the Ethiopian king Ergamenes, who had a Greek education, and was
contemporary with Ptolemy Philadelphus.

It will be remarked, that there is a vast difference between
these monuments in Ethiopia, and the magnificent architectural
edifices erected at that period in Egypt; but we must recollect,
that the dynasty of the Ptolemies infused fresh vigour into every
pursuit connected with the prosperity of the country. The first
kings of that dynasty occupied themselves almost exclusively in
promoting the commerce and encouraging the literature and arts of
the country. The sculpture indeed was then very inferior to the pure
Egyptian; but their temples, notwithstanding this inferiority, may
rank among the most splendid edifices which ornament the banks of
the Nile, or even any part of the world. But Meroe did not enjoy the
same advantage. The extended commerce of her rival would of course
diminish more and more her own prosperity. Her territory declining
continually in richness and affluence, and her commerce impaired,
her kings, instead of occupying themselves in encouraging the arts,
would require all the resources of the state to save them from
becoming the prey of their more powerful neighbour.

The next and only additional edifice which I have now to notice,
as marking the last epoch in the history of the arts of Meroe, is
the Christian church opposite Gibel el Birkel. As we have no certain
ground to suppose that Christianity was much spread in Ethiopia before
the year 330[95], a later date cannot be assigned to that structure. I
conceive it to be one of the earliest Christian edifices erected in
that country, as I have remarked, in my description of it, that it
is ornamented with the Ethiopian cornice and beading. This is the
most modern architectural construction that now remains in Ethiopia.

The Arabs at their invasion do not seem to have brought with them
the talent and means to erect any of those splendid mosques which
they have reared in honour of their prophet in other climes. I have
elsewhere described the dwellings of the present inhabitants. They are
miserable mud and straw huts, some of the latter having conical roofs,
a remnant of the knowledge of the arch. The fortified castles of the
chiefs are superior to these, but necessity only has taught them to
build towers and thick walls for their protection: nothing can be
more barbarous and rude than their internal structure. For the man
who has made himself independent, or is ignorant, of the luxuries,
elegancies, and comforts of life, they are perhaps sufficient, since
they afford shelter against the summer heat, the occasional showers
of rain, and the winter cold; but it is impossible to have a more
striking evidence of the effects of civilisation, than the contrast
between the wretched abodes of the present inhabitants of Ethiopia,
and the magnificent sepulchres of her departed kings.

Some writers even of ability affect to doubt the civilisation
and great power of the Ethiopians and Egyptians, particularly
the latter. They reason on the present condition of the country,
without reflecting on the great changes it has undergone. I may add,
that they display little knowledge of Egyptian subjects, and even of
the history of the arts in general. They would otherwise be aware
of the time necessary for a nation to acquire the degree of taste,
knowledge, and affluence, necessary for the construction of such
edifices as those still existing in the valley of the Nile. Setting
aside altogether the authority of historians, let us only compare
the present inhabitants, who are almost destitute of any ideas or
information, incapable even of rearing for themselves a suitable
abode, with a nation whose architectural proficiency has never been
surpassed, and whose advancement in so many branches of science and
civilisation is established by the indisputable evidence of lapidary
inscriptions. It were vain to expect to find at the present day in
this part of Ethiopia, an individual capable of constructing such
edifices as we have seen existing at Meroe. I do not hesitate to say,
that were it possible to transport one of the pyramids of Meroe
entire to London, it would be considered one of the most chaste
and beautiful ornaments of our metropolis. Though constructed more
perhaps than three thousand years ago, it might, even now, be studied
with advantage by our artists and architects.

When such observations are applied to Egypt, the answer is still
more easily made. Where in Europe is there an edifice like the
great temple at Karnak, one hall of which contains 140 columns,
36 feet in circumference, dimensions rarely to be found in Europe,
and every portion of that splendid court covered with carefully
finished and painted sculptures? Having, however, trespassed so long
on the reader’s patience, I must not now allow myself to enter
on the subject of Egyptian art. I will only say, in conclusion,
that the materials used in the pyramids of Memphis are sufficient
to construct a city, and that no palaces of Europe are comparable
in splendour to the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes.

FOOTNOTES:


[Footnote 1: I possess numerous notes and drawings of the antiquities
in the lower valley of the Nile, selections from which I had some
intention of publishing, as intimated several times in my journal. But
I doubt much now if I shall enter on a field in which there are
already so many competitors. Signor Rosellini’s magnificent work is
already well known to the literary world. That of Champollion will,
I believe, soon appear. Mr. Wilkinson’s invaluable work, “Thebes,
and General View of Egypt,” with his most accurate map of that
interesting city, are already before the public. The same author has
promised us an account of the private life of the Egyptians; and such
a subject could not be in more learned hands. I trust the result of
Mr. Burton’s residence of above twelve years in that country will
soon appear. Mr. Hay’s portfolio is the most magnificent which has
ever been brought from that country. It comprises plans, sections,
and detailed drawings, by eminent architects; also delineations of
sculpture from the tombs and temples, by himself and able artists,
whom he employed; with a complete series of picturesque views,
entirely by his own pencil. Mr. Lane, Dr. Hogg, and others, are on the
eve of publishing. In mentioning the interesting works which I hope
will soon appear, I cannot refrain from expressing my regret, that
the valuable labours and researches of the above English travellers
in that classic soil have not been combined for the formation of a
great national work,—an imperishable monument of public utility
and individual enterprise.

I refer the reader, with great pleasure, to the fifth volume of the
Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, in which there is a very
interesting description of the peninsula of Sennaar, communicated

published before this volume was completed, I should have availed
myself of the information which it contains; but I am glad to find
that in many respects it confirms my statement.]

[Footnote 5: It somewhat resembled, also, what Festus says of the
Salian dancers: the præsaltor advanced “et amptruabat,” then
all the rest came “et redamptruabant,” or danced and sang as he
had done.—SIR WM. GELL, T. R. vol. ii. p. 385.]

[Footnote 7: The reader will have observed that my estimate of
the pace of the camel differs from those of many travellers, and
particularly from that of Mr. Burnes, the author of the justly
celebrated work “Travels into Bokhara” (see vol. ii. p. 149.);
but he must recollect that my camels were of the Bishareen race. My
servants were all mounted; and the animals, even at starting, were
not heavily laden with a stock of water, which diminished daily. There
being only one well containing water, and that bad, in a distance of
250 miles, it was their interest to urge on their camels, which they
did by singing in the manner I have described. I took great pains
to ascertain the pace of these animals, observing not only theirs,
but also that of the drivers walking by their side, dismounting
repeatedly myself for that purpose. I had the gratification to find,
on arriving at the Nile, that my calculations agreed, within two
or three miles, with the observations of latitude. I have made many
long journeys on camels, and I certainly think that animal, when well
taken care of, and not overloaded, fully capable of marching ten or
eleven hours per day, at the average rate of two miles and a half
an hour in valleys or over rough roads, and three miles on plains,
without being _at all_ distressed. On the banks of rivers, and in
districts where water and forage are plentiful, except urged on,
the men are always inclined to move more slowly, and make a shorter
day’s journey, not so much to save their camels as to lessen the
fatigue to themselves: a few days more or less _en route_ being
generally a matter of indifference to them.]

[Footnote 8: Burckhardt calls them angareyg, and says the peculiar
smell of the leather some of them are made of keeps them free from
vermin. I conceive it to be rather the excessive heat of the climate
that preserves the inhabitants of these latitudes from the plagues
of Egypt.]

[Footnote 9: These flies also annoy the cattle; but neither here
nor on the Mugrum (the Astaboras) have they the effect described
by Bruce.]

[Footnote 10: The specimens which I brought to England have confirmed
the accuracy of the description of them in Cailliaud’s work—“Cette
coquille, bien reconnue aujourd-hui comme devant appartenir au genre
éthérie, est remarquable par son talon, qui souvent semble s’accroître
et présenter nombre de compartimens. J’avais conservé de ces valves
d’éthéries qui avaient jusqu’à huit ou dix poules de longueur: la forme
en est alongée et variée, la nacre blanche et feuilletée. Les deux
attaches musculaires semblent être le seul motif qui jusqu’à present
a fait placer ces éthéries avec les cames plutôt qu’avec les huîtres,
dont elles ont du reste tout le caractère.”—Vol. ii. p. 222.]

[Footnote 11: “Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who

driver. The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth
after every green thing.”]

the time of the Ptolemies, seem to have divined the cause; and Homer
(vide Odyssey, book iv. ver. 581.), when he describes the Nile as
descending from heaven, apparently alludes to the rain in Ethiopia;
but at the time of Herodotus it is certain that the Egyptians were
not acquainted with the true cause; and Moses, in describing the
promised land (Deut. ch. xi. ver. 10.), “not as the land of Egypt,
but as a land of hills and valleys, which drinketh water of the
rain of heaven,” that is, owed its fertility to the rain that fell
from the clouds, would not have used those expressions, had he been
exhorting a people aware that the rain in Ethiopia was the cause
of the rising of the Nile; the source of the productiveness of the
two countries being the same, although in the one more immediate,
and therefore more apparent.]

Arabs adopt very generally this method of preserving the recollection
of any important event. There is a curious one about the Deftar Dar
Bey, when he avenged the death of Ismael Pasha on the Shendyans. He
is represented as coming as swift as the ostrich; “burning the
fakeers,” and “killing the sheakhs.”]

as he was anxious to make a copy of the Koran.]

[Footnote 44: “Le 17 Avril nous eûmes occasion de voir à Beit el
Fakih un exemple du sangfroid et de la fermeté des Arabes. Le feu
prit à une maison à l’extrémité méridionale, et, comme le vent
soufflait du sud avec violence, en peu de tems la plus grande partie
de la ville fut dévorée par les flammes: cependant les habitants
restaient tranquilles: on n’entendait dans les rues ni cris, ni
lamentations; et quand on plaignait leur sort, ils répliquaient,
C’est la volonté de Dieu. Nous occupions une maison de pierre dans
un quartier que les flammes épargnèrent: montés sur notre toit
nous vîmes les toits des autres maisons, remplis de spectateurs,
qui regardaient tranquillement l’incendie. Un savant pauvre, qui
nous rendait souvent des visites, vint à nous voir après avoir mis
en sûreté ses effets, et nous indiqua d’un air indifférent le
moment où sa maison s’embrasa.”]

[Footnote 45: The title which all travellers, who remain any time
in Egypt, generally take, is that of Effende. There are two great
advantages in assuming a Turkish name:—it affords greater facility
to the natives in recollecting it, and it likewise prevents your
being called Howwajee, merchant, or, rather, pedler; and as that
class of persons are, in this country, rarely respectable, either
from their morals or station, an Englishman submitting to such a
title, of course, lowers himself, both in the eyes of the Turks and
natives. The Arabs, among themselves, often have other names for
Europeans. I was called Abou Toweel, Father of the tall. Rosellini
had a name in reference to his beard (Abou Dagan); Champollion
(Abou Galeed), from his corpulency; and a noble traveller, who has
surpassed us all in the extent of his journey up the Nile, was called,
I am told, Abou Dagegah, or Father of the Minutes, from the report
having spread that he had a dollar every minute. The Turks and Arabs
of these provinces, where travellers are more rare, sometimes honour
me with the title of Bey Zadé, or, Son of a Governor.]

[Footnote 46: My servant having broken my thermometer at Gibel el
Birkel, I have, unfortunately, been unable to ascertain the heat here:
I can only remark, that the temperature for these last three months
has increased perceptibly every week. Some travellers have stated
that the extreme heat in Nubia is in April. Such an observation,
if not entirely an error, can only be applicable to that part where
heavy tropical rains fall. On the 11th of March (see p. 97.) we had
110° in the shade; but although that was the commencement of the
extreme heat, and for that reason more difficult to support, I did
not experience so great an inconvenience from it as at present. The
natives did not then complain as they do now, nor did my servants
from Cairo and Thebes suffer so much. They were all ill at El Ourde,
and I thought my Greek servant Ibrahim would have died.]

[Footnote 47: Mr. Waddington’s Travels in Ethiopia contain a view
and plan of this temple, and also some views of Gibel el Birkel. I
have avoided, as much as possible, the disagreeable task of swelling
my text with criticisms on the observations and plates of Monsieur
Cailliaud. It would, however, be unjust and ungenerous to make any
observation on the views of Mr. Waddington, as he states candidly
that he was no draughtsman; yet, as no other views had been published,
he was, of course, justified in giving such as he possessed.]

[Footnote 48: The names of these two kings occurring together
at Semneh, where Thothmes is represented worshipping his ancestor
Osirtisen as a god, is confirmatory of the accuracy of the supposition
that these are the names in the tomb at Doshe.]

[Footnote 49: See Bruce’s account of the reverence and adoration
of the Agous at the source of the Nile.]

[Footnote 50: Inscription No. 1. is from the same portico, and
opposite to a large figure, similar to the one in Plate X., Sculpture,
Meroe. No. 2. is before a figure presenting offerings. No. 4. before
a figure of Anubis. No. 5. before a figure of Horus. The tablet,
No. 3. is in the same portico, over a figure kneeling before a funeral
boat, very much defaced, at the end of the portico. As will be seen
by the plate, these inscriptions are very much injured; but, although
the least perfect of any that I possess, I publish them, because they
are the most important, being from the pyramids of Meroe. No. 6. is
an inscription which was above the sculpture on one side of the first
chamber excavated out of the rock of the Temple of Tirhaka, Gibel
el Birkel. No 7. is another portion of this apparently dedicatory
inscription, going round the whole of the room. The hieroglyphics are
large, well executed, and very legible, except some which were quite
defaced, and others almost covered with dirt. No. 8. are fragments
from the large granite altar in the western corner of the great
Temple, Gibel el Birkel. The first line is on the south-east side,
the second on the north-east; the remainder of the hieroglyphics on
this altar I have not been able to publish. Plate LIII. shows the
two subjects on the altar in the sanctuary of the same temple. (See
Plate XXIV.) I have alluded to them in my description of the ruins.]

[Footnote 51: His name is also found in the tomb near Solib, and on
the rocks at Toumbos.]

[Footnote 52: Since I wrote the above, I have seen the two beautiful
granite lions which were brought from Gibel el Birkel, and presented
to the British Museum, by Lord Prudhoe. The sculpture is most
beautiful. They appear to be of the same period, as their attitude
is similar; otherwise, their forms are different. The one which is
the most defaced, and has been apparently the most symmetrical,
bears the name of Amunoph III., in deep intaglio. As the name of
this king does not exist on any edifice at Gibel el Birkel, I think
the circumstance of the lion bearing his name being found there, no
decisive proof of his having penetrated so far south. The sculpture
is too good to be Ethiopian, and the granite is not of a description
I met with near there. Gibel el Birkel, whatever might be its ancient
name, was evidently the capital and favoured city of Tirhaka, who
might, on his abdication of the throne of Egypt, have brought away
these splendid specimens of Egyptian art. The nomen and prænomen on
the other are not Egyptian, but seem to be of a king called Amnasre,
or Amun Asre.]

[Footnote 56: Pausanias correctly states the vocal statue of Memnon at
Thebes was by the natives called Phamenoph (that is, Amunoph III.),
the name it actually bears; and it certainly is curious, that this
is the very king whose name we find in Ethiopia at Solib, and on
the lion, as I have stated, brought from Gibel el Birkel. That
king may possibly have been master of a portion of Ethiopia, and
styled himself, as was often the custom, king of the Upper and
Lower Countries; but he could not have been the Ethiopian Memnon,
who marched to the succour of Troy: for the king who reigned in
Egypt at the time of the Trojan war was Osirei, or Menephtah II.;
and Amunoph III. died more than a century and a half before that
event. As no edifices remain bearing the name of this king south
of Solib, which is not a hundred miles above the second cataract,
I see no just reason, as I have said before, for supposing that he
carried his arms to Gibel el Birkel, much less to Meroe.]

Meroe. (See Plate X.) There is a fragment of a figure of a god,
with the hieroglyphics before it; this is evidently the god Sebek,
which, with the Greek termination, makes the Sevechus of Eusebius;
but, although the name in the list and that of Eusebius and Africanus
are made thus to agree with the name in the Bible, I have some doubts
if Signor Rosellini is correct in the connection he supposes between
the name of these hieroglyphics and the god Sevek; for the Ethiopians
apparently wrote the name of that deity in the same manner as the
Egyptians, and yet not one of the hieroglyphics used in writing the
name of the god is employed in that of the king.]

[Footnote 75: The following description, extracted from the journal
of my first voyage up the Nile, may amuse the reader:—

“April 8. 1832.—Our pilot afforded us a curious exhibition,
although not, I believe, uncommon; but to us it was new. He pretended
or believed that his saint, to whom he had been addressing his
evening devotions, had entered his body, and he immediately fell
into the most violent paroxysms, throwing his arms about, rolling
his head, and twisting his body in a very outrageous manner:
sometimes he held up his hands, and shook, as in the most dreadful
convulsions, groaning most piteously, and gabbling forth all sorts of
gibberish. The sailors made a circle round him, and continued making
low obeisances, calling on Mahomet to assist him, for nearly two
hours; they believe that, unless they did this, the saint would never
leave him, and he would have probably died. The man, in his madness,
seemed to have a great jealousy for his honour; one of the mariners
was sleeping on board the boat, while the others were on the banks
praying for them; on a sudden he darted into the boat, and, had he
not been detained, would have roughly used the drowsy mariner. After
all the Mahometans near him had joined the circle to pray for his
recovery, he returned, by degrees, to his senses: when the fit was
over, he lay for some time apparently quite exhausted. The man is
remarkable at other times for the mildness of his manner, and is one
of the finest looking Nubians I have seen, being above six feet high,
with uncommonly handsome features. The people consider those who are
thus possessed as peculiarly favoured, not one in a thousand being
so fortunate. After death they are generally considered as saints,
and have tombs erected to them by the government, which does this,
no doubt, to gain popularity, or conciliate the people: but it
is generally believed that the saint has appeared to the Pasha,
ordering him to erect it.”]

as Gibel el Birkel; but there is no other Egyptian name on any rocks

[Footnote 82: Herodotus (Thalia, 114.) describes Ethiopia as the
last of the inhabited regions of the earth, and possessed by men of
very great stature, beautiful, and of very long life; adding, that
it produces much gold, and very large elephants, with long teeth,
wild trees of every description, and ebony.]

[Footnote 83: Diodorus (lib. iii. p. 105.) says, that near the
confines of Egypt and the adjacent Ethiopia and Arabia, there is a
place which abounds in rich gold mines, whence, at a great expense
and toil of a great multitude of criminals, gold is dug. He speaks
also of the manner they pounded the gold; and also mentions veins
of white marble. It is a singular coincidence, that at the mines
in the great Nubian desert, there are actually remaining mortars
exactly such as he describes; and, with one exception, the only
place I found white marble during this journey was in that desert,
not far from the mines. The marble, however, may perhaps be the
white quartz the gold is found in.]

[Footnote 84: On the road to Abou Hashim, in the kingdom of Berber,
and other places, I found rocks of sandstone, much charged with iron,
and beyond Sennaar, they say that there are iron mines.]

[Footnote 85: I regret that in some few of the impressions the caps
were printed black. The reader must be aware, that the management of
such engravings as these is excessively difficult. Four colours are
impressed from separate stones—red, blue, black, and the ground. The
others were put in by hand. I took great pains in superintending the
mixing of the colours, to give the reader as exact a representation of
an Egyptian painting as was in my power. I am indebted to Mr. Bonomi
for having drawn for me on the stones these and the other plates
of sculpture.]

[Footnote 86: The past and present condition of Ethiopia are so
admirably described in the first two verses, chap. xviii. of Isaiah,
and the prophecy so admirably fulfilled, that I cannot refrain from
repeating them:—“Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is
beyond the rivers of Ethiopia: that sendeth ambassadors by the sea,
even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift
messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible
from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down,
whose land the rivers have spoiled!” Can the expression “shadowing
with wings” allude to the winged globe on all the edifices in
Egypt and Ethiopia? Vessels of bulrushes are highly characteristic
of a wild tribe in the interior, almost similar ones being used at
the present day; but the “nation, terrible from the beginning,
meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled,”
can only be Ethiopia.]

[Footnote 87: Strabo mentions that Coptos was the entrepôt, not
only of the merchandise of Ethiopia, but also of India and Arabia.]

[Footnote 88: Isaiah (xlv. 14.) also mentions the “merchandise
of Ethiopia.”]

[Footnote 94: This is no new doctrine of my own: Champollion,
Rosellini, Heeren, and many other first-rate authorities have the
same idea. I had expressed no opinion on the subject before going
into the country; and, therefore, without prejudice, examined the
evidence afforded by the monuments. At the same time that I deeply
regret, that many learned travellers and geographers differ with me
on this important point, I have not feared to express my own opinion;
and I trust it will be candidly allowed, that in my topographical
description I have not omitted any observation that might militate
against my argument. I have stated, that in the latitude of Shendy it
occasionally rains, (but Cailliaud is mistaken in supposing that it
rains there three months in the year,) and that such rain would have a
certain effect even on the solid mass of a pyramid. I have mentioned,
also, that the stones are smaller, and often of a softer material,
than the sandstone of Egypt; but we must consider that the pyramids
are also smaller, that they have no rooms in the interior, and that
the material of the least durable is harder than that of many of
the pyramids of Memphis. Mr. Waddington did not reach the wonderful
cemetery of the metropolis of Meroe, but the result of his comparison
of the other pyramids of Ethiopia with those of Egypt agrees with
mine, that is to say, as regards their relative antiquity; but from
the discoveries in hieroglyphics, Mr. W. is found to be wrong in the
dates he assigns to the monuments of Memphis and Thebes. But I cannot
conclude this subject better than with an extract from his work.

He says (Journal of a Visit to some Parts of Ethiopia, p. 184),
“Now, the utter destruction and shapelessness of many of the
pyramids at Birkel and El Bellal (Nouri), attest their antiquity;
while those of Egypt do not appear to have been erected above eleven
or twelve hundred years before Christ, when that country had been
frequently overrun by the Ethiopians;”—alluding to the statement
of Herodotus, that eighteen of the kings of Egypt were Ethiopians;
but Manethon and the monuments do not confirm this account, and,
therefore, I have not mentioned it before. “The pyramids are of
a later date than the ruins of Thebes. Thebes, which is known to
have been founded by a colony of Ethiopians[a], was called Ammon
No, Diospolis, or the city of Ammon. It follows, then, I think, very
clearly, from the concurrence of these observations on the antiquities
of Ethiopia, with the conclusions derived from historical evidence,
that the origin of the Egyptian divinities, as well as that of their
temples and their tombs, and of the sculptures, figures, and symbols,
may be traced to Ethiopia. In the magnitude of their edifices, the
imitators have, indeed, surpassed their masters; but, as far as
we could judge from the granite and other sculptures at Argo and
Gibel el Birkel, that art seems to have been as well understood,
and carried to as high perfection, as it was afterwards by their
scholars at Thebes and at Memphis.]

[Footnote a: Bruce’s Travels, vol. i. p. 380. The words of Bruce
are,—“We know that Thebes was a colony of Ethiopians, and probably
from Meroe; but whether directly or not we are not certain.” There
is, I believe, no passage distinctly stating this; but Bruce very
correctly inferred it from the statements of Diodorus and Herodotus.]
